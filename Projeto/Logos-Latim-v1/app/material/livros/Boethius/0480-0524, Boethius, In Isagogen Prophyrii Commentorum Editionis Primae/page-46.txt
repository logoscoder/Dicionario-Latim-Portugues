NOTES ON THE TEXT
<1> [1.02.03] et agnouerit] all manuscripts have et agnouerit except F, which has et agnoscere, and Sm1,
which has just agnoscere. Brandt adopts F, but then the subject for [potest] agnoscere is the impersonal subject of
uenerit, whereas for potest inuenire it changes to rerum incorrupta ueritas.
<2> [1.05.02] utilia] codd. utili em. Busse + Minio-Paluello (following the Greek).
<3> [1.05.02] opusculum] with many manuscripts rather than corpusculum with Busse.
<4> [1.10.16] unius ui nominis includat] according to Brandt, the manuscripts used in his edition have the
following readings here:
L:
unius sui nominis uocabulo concludit includat
P:
unius sui nominis uocabulo includat
H:
unius ui nominis uocabulo concludat
R:
unius ui hominis includit
CEFGNS:
unius ui nominis includat
Brandt follows P, which makes dubious sense -- Spade renders it "including that multiplicity in the word
expressing [?] its one name". The common reading is CEFGNS (and R has only a clear scribal error to set it apart),
which I have adopted in preference to the variants in LPH: only LH give a version of concludere and L corrects it; the
characters that compose unius ui could be misread as unius sui, taking the final 's' of unius to go also with the three
following minims, leading to [s]ui rather than ui; the addition uocabulo is hard to construe with the rest of the sentence
-- and, last but not least, the philosophical sense is clear on this reading.
<5> [3.10.01] differentibus] iffdiertenbus (?!)
