quibusdam contumacibus in eiusmodi prosecutiones invectus est. Unde turri commissus est ibique remansit usque ad
mortem regis. Knesworthus quoque, nuper maior Londinensis, et uterque vicecomes eiusdem anni pro delictis
quibusdam in administratione munerum suorum in iudicium adducti, incarcerati, et postea solutione mille et
quadringintarum librarum redempti. Item Hawisus, unus ex aldermannis Londini, impetitus fuit, et dolore et anxietate
animi antequam lis ad finem perducta esset mortuus. Laurentius etiam Ailmerus eques auratus, qui similiter maior
Londinensis fuerat, et ambo eius vicecomites mulctam mille librarum subierunt. Laurentius autem, quod solvere
mulctam recusavit, custodiae commissus est, ubi remansit usquedum Empsonus ipse loco eius incarceratus esset.
14. Minime mirum erat (cum delicta tam levia, mulctae tam graves essent) si thesauri regis reconditi quos moriens
reliquit, quorumque pars maxima in locis occultis sub clave et custodia sua propria Rinchmondiae reposita erat,
ascendissent ad summam quinque millionum et dimidiae aureorum, massam certe grandem pecuniae etiam pro ratione
temporum praesentium.
15. Ultimum negotium status, quod regis huius felicitatem temporalem clausit, fuit conclusio gloriosissimum
matrimonii inter filiam suam Mariam et Carolum principem Castiliae, postea imperatorem celeberrimum, utraque
partae tenerae aetatis tunc existente. Qui tractatus consummatus erat per episcopum Foxum et alios regis delegatos
Caleti anno proximo ante regis obitum. Qua affinitate (ut videtur) ita delectatus est et quasi raptus, ut in literis quas illa
de re ad civitatem Londini scripsit (mandans ut omnia laetitiae et exultationis indicia exhiberent), gloriatur ac si muro
aheneo regnum illud circumdedisset, cum generos sibi iam ascivisset regem Scotiae et principem Castiliae ac
Burgundiae. Ita ut iam nihil videretur addi posse ad huius magni regis mundanam felicitatem usque ad summum
fastigium evectum (sive quis intueatur excelsas illas liberorum suorum nuptias, sive famam eius longe lateque per
orbem sparsam, sive divitias fidem fere superantes, sive successuum suorum perpetuam constantiam), praeter mortem
opportunam quae eum ab aliquo fortunae impetu futuro subduceret. Qui certe (propter odia populi sui et titulum filii
sui, tunc aetatem octodecim annorum implentis, principis certe audacis et liberalis, quique ipso aspectu et oris maiestate
oculos populi in se trahebat) fortasse in eum irruere potuisset.
16. Ad coronandum etiam vitae suae exitium, aeque ac regni sui initium, opus pietatis et misericordiae edidit eximium
et imitatione dignum. Nam condonationem generalem promulgavit qualis in coronatione regum concedi solet, ut certus
novae coronationis in regno meliore. Quin et testimonio suo declaravit se velle, ut restitutio fieret earum summarum
pecuniae quae ab officiariis suis iniuste extorta fuissent.
17. Hoc modo Salomon iste Anglorum (nam et Salomon ipse exactionibus populo suo gravis fuit), cum quinquaginta
suos annos vixisset, atque viginti tres anno et octo menses regnasset, memoria integra et statu animae beatissimo in
magna malacia morbi lenti ad coelum migravit vicesimo secundo Aprilis anno salutis 1508 apud palatium suum
Richmondiae, quod ipse exaedificaverat.
XI.
HIS King (to speak of him terms equal to his deserving) was one of the best sort of wonders; a wonder for wise men,
He had parts (both in his virtues and his fortune) not so fit for a common-place as an observation. Certainly he was
religious, both in his affection and observance. But as he could see clear (for those times) through superstition; so he
would be blinded now and then by human policy. He advanced church-men. He was tender in the privilege of
sanctuaries, though they wrought him much mischief. He built and endowed many religious foundations, besides his
memorable hospital of the Savoy: and yet he was a great alms-giver in secret; which shewed that his works in public
were dedicated rather to God’s glory than his own. He professed always to love and seek peace; and it was his usual
preface to his treaties, that when Christ came into the world peace was sung,and when he went ouf the world peace was
bequeathed. And this virtue could not proceed out of fear or softness, for he was valiant and active; and therefore no
doubt it was truly Christian and moral. Yet he knew the way to peace was not seem to be desirous to avoid wars.
Therefore would he make offers and fames of wars, till he had mended the conditions of peace. It was also much, that
one was so great a lover of peace should be so happy in war. For his arms, either in foreign or civil wars, were never
infortunate; neither did he know what a disaster meant. The war of his coming in, and the rebellions of the Earl of
Lincoln and the Lord Audley, were ended by victory. The wars of France and Scotland by peaces sought at his hands.
That of Brittaine by accident of the Duke’s death. The insurrection of the Lord Lovell, and that of Perkin at Exeter and
in Kent, by flight of the rebels before they came to blows. So that his fortune of arms was still involate. The rather sure,
for that in the quenching of the commotions of his subjects he ever went in person: sometimes reserving himself to
back and second his lieutenants, but ever in action. And yet that was not merely forwardness, but partly distrust of
others.
2. He did much maintain and countenance his laws; which (nevertheless) was no impediment to him to work his will.
For it was so handled that neither prerogative nor profit went to diminution. And yet as he would sometimes strain up
his laws to his prerogative, so would he also let down his prerogative to his Parliament. For mint and wars and martial
discipline (things of absolute power) he would nevertheless bring to Parliament. Justice was well administered in his
