The youngest son of Gualdrada and Guido Guerra III, Aghinolfo was a judge and captain of the knights of
Pistoia in 1237, according to the family tree given in BERTHOLD STAHL Adel und Volk im Florentiner
Dugento Studi italiani 8 (Cologne 1965) .

Ruggero died in 1229 or 1230, leaving two sons and a posthumous child. He had been podesta of Lucca in
1224 according to the family tree given in BERTHOLD STAHL Adel und Volk im Florentiner Dugento, Studi
italiani 8 (Cologne 1965).

The second eldest surviving son of Guido Guerra III, Marcualdo was styled count of Dovadola, a Guidi castle
18 km. southwest of Forli, on the Montone river, and 13 km. southeast of Modigliana, the main Guidi
stronghold. Castel Ruggiero is located nearby. Marcualdo married Beatrix of Capraia before 1220, when their
first son Guido was born.

Guido Guerra is the only count palatine in the Boncompagnus, except for one `H. comes palatinus' who is
marrying the daughter of the duke of Austria,. In the Oliva c.54, both Guido Guerra and Aldobrandinus have this
title.

Boncompagno served as a Firmpaten for Marcualdo's confirmation, which probably took place in 1199 (see
note 9) or ca. 1207-1209 (see Boncompagnus 1.13.1 §3). Gualdrada is called Boncompagno's commater in
Boncompagnus 1.25.11, which was written after 1215; Marcualdo's annointment had united them in spiritual
kinship of coparentage. Marcualdo's baptismal godfather was the Staufer magnate Markward of Annweiler,
whom he served as a page. See WERNER GOEZ "Ein Brief des Grafen Guido Guerra III. an Markward von
Annweiler" DA 32 (1976) 131-146. --- On spiritual coparentage, see JOSEPH LYNCH Godparents and Spiritual
Kinship in Early Medieval Europe (Princeton 1987), KARL HAUCK "Formes de parente artificielle dans le haut
moyen age" in Famille et parente dans l'occident medieval ed. GEORGES DUBY and JACQUES LE GOFF

Summa Decretalium 4.11 §1 (ed. LASPEYRES 157-8): Cognatio spiritualis est propinquitas proveniens ex
sacramenti datione vel ad id detentione, ut ecce: sacerdos baptizat parvulum, te eum suscipis, uterque vestrum
est eius pater spiritualis, ut C. XXX. qu. 1 Omnes...; 4.11 §5 (ed. LASPEYRES 159-160): Quia vero diximus,
cognationem spiritualem per sacramenta ecclesiastica provenire, videamus, per que sacramenta contrahatur.
Sciendum est igitur, quod secundum veritatem et consuetudinem tantum tria sunt sacramenta, que
compaternitatem impedientem matrimonium inducunt, videlicet sacramentum Christianitatis, et sacramentum
baptismi, et sacramentum consecrationis ab episcopo facte. Citations: C. 30 qu.1 c. 1, qu. 4, c. 3, De
consecratione D. 4 c. 100.

Hugo, cardinal bishop of Ostia and Velletri (1207-1227), pope Gregory IX (1227-1241). For Hugo's activities
as a papal legate to Germany in 1207-1208 and in 1209, accompanied by cardinal Leo Brancaleonis of S. Croce,
see RNI 141-149, 178-184 and Boncompagnus 5.1.23. Boncompagno met the legates (perhaps in Bologna) in
early summer of 1207 (Boncompagnus 1.13.1). WERNER MALECZEK Papst und Kardinalskolleg von 11911216 (Vienna 1984) 126-133. --- Hugo also served as a legate in Lombardy, 1216-1219 and in northern Italy
1221, ie. Tuscany, Emilia, Lombardy and the Veneto. This 1221 legation may be followed in the Registri dei
cardinali Ugolino d'Ostia et Ottaviano degli Ubaldini ed. GUIDO LEVI (Rome, 1890). The subscriptions show
that Niccolo di Reggio took part on this legation, preaching the Crusade and gathering a large number of troops
from Emilia.

The word 'tunc' might carry an adversative meaning here, signifying that Ugolino's legation took place before
he was raised to the episcopacy. In that case, the legation took place in summer 1199, to Markward of Annweiler
in Veroli. (Perhaps this has something to do with composition of Isagoge). --- Hugo's fellow legates were
cardinal bishop Octavian of Ostia and Guido cardinal presbyter of S. Maria in Trastevere (on Octavian see
Boncompagnus 3.16.5, on Guido 3.16.16). Markward died September 1202. Cf. F. BAETHGEN Die
Regentschaft Papst Innocenz III im Königreich Sizilien (Heidelberger Abh. 44, 1914); THOMAS VAN CLEVE
Markward of Annweiler and the Sicilian Regency (Princeton 1937).

The rest of this letter (or perhaps only §4-§7) is thus an opusculum or a treatise titled De iactura et malo
divisionis commissioned by the Guidi consorteria. But like any medieval letter-treatise, it also addresses a wider
audience. Boncompagnus 4.4.25-26 concerns two brothers contending for a division of their inheritance.
Boncompagno seems to have applied to Bohemia the actual dispute between the brothers Emmerich (1196-1204)
and Andreas II (1205-1235) claimants to the Hungarian throne. See also Boncompagnus 1.20.7.
