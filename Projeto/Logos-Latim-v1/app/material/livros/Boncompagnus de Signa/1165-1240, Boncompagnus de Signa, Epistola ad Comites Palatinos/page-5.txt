Dan 5.25, Gen. 38.29, cf. also Boncompagnus 5.1.26 §4, and 1.2.16. Although this term might not be wholly
unfamiliar from medieval Latin (phariseare = to divide), Daniel's interpretation of phares on the Aramaic menetekel-u-pharsin inscription is: divisum est tuum regnum; in Genesis 38.29 the midwife names the second of twins
who pushes past his brother at birth 'Phares', saying that on his account the wall was broken ( quare divisa est
propter te maceria et ob hanc causam vocavit nomen eius Phares). This Phares, the son of Iudas and Tamar,
who has nothing to do with Boncompagno's sinister 'Divider', also appears at Num 26.30, 1. Par 2.4, Ruth 4.12,
Matt 1.3, Luc 3.33. --- See A. VIVIAN I campi lessicali della 'separazione' nell'ebraico biblico, di Qumran e
della Mishna (Florence 1978).

Only four sons are named in the salutation. Guido Guerra's third son, Tegrimo II, was not referred to by name
in the salutation of this letter. Although the family tree published by STAHL indicates that Tegrimo served as a
consul of Florence in 1192, this was probably another person, because Gualdrada's son Tegrimo was podesta of
Arezzo in 1237 and of Pisa in 1239. See below, §9.

See §10, below.

Gen 4.8. manus dextera used by synecdoche for a brother. See RICARDO QUINONES The Changes of Cain:
Violence and the Lost Brother in Cain and Abel Literature (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University 1991),
chapter 3, for analysis of Dante and 13th c. Tuscan fratricide, including the 'blood sacrifice' of Buondelmonde in
1215.

Gen. 25.22. This elaboration of the story of Esau and Jacob jostling in Rebecca's womb is typical of
Boncompagno's interest in medicine (see also below, §14). Another interesting Biblical story of the birth of
twins is Gen. 38.29. However, the pertinence of Jacob and Esau to the problem of division is marked in the
Lord's words to Rebecca in Gen. 25.23: Duae gentes in utero tuo sunt, et duo populi ex ventre tuo dividentur,
populusque populum superabit et maior minori serviet.

Gen. 37.5-28.

As an alternative to the Virgilian picture of a pius Aeneas, the story of Aeneas' (and his brother Antenor's)
conspiracy with the Greeks was transmitted to the Middle Ages by a pair of demythologizing forgeries from Late
Antiquity: the Latin tr. by Lucius Septimius' of Diktys Cretensis Ephemeris belli Troiani (Teubner, ed. W.
EISENHUT 19732) and Dares Phrygius De excidio Troiae historia (Teubner, ed. F. MEISTER, 1873)--both
based on Hellenistic Greek models. --- See HANS FROMM "Eneas der Verräter" in JOHANNES JANOTA ed.
Festschrift Walter Haug und Burghart Wachinger (Tübingen 1992) 1.139-163.

Although I would translate causa divisionum 'because of divisions', a more technical legal translation is
possible. The action (causa) for a divisio hereditatis is treated in Digest 10.2, see also Digest 26.8.20, 45.1.122 §
6 and above §4.

JULIUS FICKER Vom Reichsfürstenstande (Innsbruck 1861) 1.xxviii and 243: "Bei den Magnaten Italiens
geht der Titel auf alle Familienglieder...so finden wir mehrere Brüder als Margrafen von Este oder Pfalzgrafen
von Tuscien; ganze Sippeschaften führen den Amtstitel fort." However, according to Boncompagno, this had not
happened in the Guidi family before the sharing of the title among Guido Guerra II's heirs, establishing a
consorteria. --- A short discussion of the consorteria is found in DAVID HERLIHY Medieval Households
(London 1985) 88-92. Two articles in Famille et parente dans l'occident medieval ed. GEORGES DUBY and
JACQUES LE GOFF (Rome 1977) provide more detail and an introduction to the literature: CINZIO
VIOLANTE "Quelques caracteristiques des structures familiales en Lombardie, Emilie et Toscane aux XIe et
XIIe siecles" (pp. 88-151) and GIOVANNI TABACCO "Le rapport de parente comme instrument de domination
consortiale: quelques exemples piemontais" (153-158). The standard work is F. NICCOLAI I consorzi nobiliari
