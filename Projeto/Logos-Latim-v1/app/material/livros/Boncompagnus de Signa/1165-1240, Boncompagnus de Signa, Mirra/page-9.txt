make testaments during lucid intervals; a deaf-mute person could make a testment if he was mute through an
injury and not from birth and if he could write and so wrote his own testament or if he commissioned someone
else to do so with the emperor's permission (the case of someone mute but not deaf from nature is considered
nearly impossible); a very careful procedure for drawing up the will of a blind man was allowed; a condemned
man who shall not lose his status before the execution can make a will. Finally Azo says that a presbyter cannot
make a will. Boncompagno's unwillingness to go through all these cases more likely suggests his knowledge of
the law than his ignorance of it.

The same distinction is made of confirmations in Oliva c.42.

This chapter does not have a rubric, probably because c. 8 is itself a list of the rubrics for cc. 9-21.

The concept of fragilitas humana, which can be traced back to Cicero (pro. Marcell. 22, Tusc.5.3, De), appears
frequently in the formulas of late Roman and early medieval testaments. See WILHELM JOHN "Formale
Beziehungen der privaten Schenkungsurkunden Italians und des Frankenreichs und die Wirksamkeit der
Formulare" Archiv für Urkundenforschung 14 (1936) 1-104 at 18-20 and HEINRICH FICHTENAUArenga:
Spätantike und Mittlelalter im Spiegel von Urkundenformeln (Cologne 1957) 126-8. It appears twice again here
(Mirra 14.1 and 19.1) and in Boncompagnus 1.25.3, 1.25.11, 1.25.19, 2.1.1, 3.12.1, 5.10.11, 5.10.16, 5.12.3; it is
also used there with special reference to lepers (4.6.5, 5.3.4) and to women (1.25.8, 3.15.16, 4.4.16, 5.4.19).
Women and adolescents are also described as flexibilis (1.25.9, 5.20.1, 5.20.9, 5.22.1), an adjective
Boncompagno applied to himself as a layman in Oliva 1.4.
