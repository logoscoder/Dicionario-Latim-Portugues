Although such advice is eminently consistent with a Boncompagno's striving for clarity in epistolary
communication, so far as the manuscript transmission can reveal, Boncompagno does not follow this precept in
the Quinque tabule salutationum and for the most part also does not in later writings. Perhaps he purposes here to
directly contradict French doctrine (e.g. Aurea Gemma <Gallica> 1.24) for the sake of scholastic opposition,
although he agreed with that doctrine in Isagoge 2.8-9. Teaching and learning by advancing contrarieties played
the same role in medieval schools as does the experimental method in modern scientific research; it need not be
seen as evidence of a personality trait.
