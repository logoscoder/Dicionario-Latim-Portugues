Sharp disagreement emerged in 1159 (Rahwin Gesta Friderici 4.21) between Barbarossa's chancery and the
papal curia concerning the correct order of address and the majestic plural. Wibald of Corvey foresaw this rift at
the very beginning of Barbaross's reign (Codex Wibaldi ep. 374). Although most 12th-century artes dictaminis
treat such matters precedence and form of address, explicit reference to the historical precedents of this conflict
appear first here and in Oliva 5.5, 19.13. Boncompagno drew here on decretist commentary to D. 97 c. 2 and the
glossators on Codex 1.1.8 (on which see Glossators and decretists on salutations). --- For a full discussion, see
my "Barbarossa's Chancery Ordinance" , unpublished paper delivered at the October 1987 UCLA Medieval
Latin
Colloquiuum.
For an earlier witness within the ars dictandi tradition to Gregory the Great's innovations in the papal titles, cf.

Geistesgeschicte des Mittelalters 3) 51.

Other references to Greek: Quinque tabule salutationum 2.6, Tractatus virtutum §3, §32, Palma 43, De
obsidione Ancone (oration of Byzantine emperor's legate); Boncompagnus 1.19.3, 1.26.4. Boncompagno
mentions one visit to Constantinople below, Quinque tabule salutationum 4.9, and his extensive accounts of
aspects of the Fifth Crusade in the Boncompagnus suggest he was an eyewitness.
29

Boncompagno rarely gives examples of bad Latin in his writings: Quinque tabule salutationum 1.30, 4.9,
Tractatus virtutum §20, §25, §28, Notule auree 16, 21, Isagoge 2.30, 2.38, 2.40, Boncompagnus 1.1.8.

See Quinque tabule salutationum 1.25, 1.26.

See below, Quinque tabule salutationum 2.16, Palma 17.5. An echo of this definition is found in
Boncompagnus 1.10.2. It was adopted by Guido Faba Summa dictaminis (ed. GAUDENZI 297.5) and Thomas
of Capua Ars dictandi 5 (ed. HELLER 17) and in other works, including the Catholicon by Johannes Balbi of
Genoa. Other definitions of the salutation are found in Palma 18.
