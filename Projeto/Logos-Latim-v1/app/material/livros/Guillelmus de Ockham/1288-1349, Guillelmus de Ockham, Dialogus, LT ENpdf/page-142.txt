Discipulus Ut cerno, secundum istos, episcopi et
inquisitores in vanum errantes corripiunt nisi
probaverint eos patenter doctrinae apostolicae
adversari. Sed adhuc ignoro quid putant de papa, an
scilicet ad simplicem correctionem papae absque tali
correctione quam vocant legitimam teneantur
nescienter errantes suas haereses revocare.

Disciple According to these people, as I understand it,
bishops and inquisitors correct in vain those who err
unless they prove that they are clearly opposed to
apostolic teaching. But I still do not know what they
think about the pope, whether, that is, those who err
unknowingly are bound to retract their heresies as the
result of simple correction by the pope, without the
sort of correction they call legitimate.

Magister Dicunt quod non: tum quia papa saepe est
illiteratus et simplex; tum quia papa de fide potest
errare contra fidem; tum quia papa de fide tenetur
reddere rationem, quia, sicut notat glossa Extra, De
rescriptis, c. Si quando, "de omnibus ratio reddi debet
si potest"; tum quia in causa fidei a papa licet
appellare; tum quia fides nostra non consistit in
sapientia papae. Nullus enim in his quae fidei sunt
tenetur credere papae nisi per regulam fidei dicti sui
rationem ostendat.

[See Significant Variants, para. 18.] Master They say,
"no". This is because (i) the pope is often unlearned
and simple, because (ii) in a matter of faith the pope
can err against the faith, because (iii) the pope is
bound to offer a reason for faith -- since, as the gloss
on Extra, De rescriptis, c. Si quando [col.35] notes, "a
reason ought to be offered for everything if it can be"
-- because (iv) in a case concerning the faith it is licit
to appeal from the pope, and because (v) our faith does
not rest on the wisdom of the pope. For no one is
bound to believe the pope in matters of faith unless the
latter shows a reason for his statement by the rule of
faith.

Discipulus Istud videtur consuetudini ecclesiae
repugnare. Nam papa aliquando damnat haereses cuius
damnationis suae nullam reddit rationem. Concilia
etiam generalia symbola condiderunt articulos
distinguentia quos tamen per regulam fidei minime
probant. Ergo non videtur quod papa semper teneatur
reddere rationem damnationis haereticae pravitatis.

Disciple That seems to be contrary to the custom of
the church. For the pope sometimes condemns heresies
without offering any reason for his condemnation;
general councils too have composed creeds, making a
distinction among articles which however they do not
prove by the rule of faith. It does not seem, therefore,
that the pope would always be bound to offer a reason
for his condemnation of heretical wickedness.

Magister Ad ista respondent quod nunquam invenitur
quod papa aliquam haeresim damnaverit et
damnationis suae non reddiderit rationem, sed
aliquando extra damnationem, aliquando in eadem
damnatione. Sic enim fecit Alexander 3, sicut patet
Extra, De haereticis, c. Cum Christus, sicut etiam
Innocentius 3 Extra, De summa trinitate et fide, c.
Damnamus. Si autem non reddit rationem in
damnatione ipsa, debet in aliis assertionibus suis
eiusdem damnationis suae reddere rationem.

Master They reply to these points that the pope has
never been found to have condemned some heresy and
not offered a reason for his condemnation; but
sometimes this [is found] outside the condemnation,
sometimes in the condemnation itself. For this is what
Alexander III did, as is clear from Extra, De
haereticis, c. Cum Christus [col.779], as also did
Innocent III, Extra, De summma trinitate et fide c.
Damnamus [col.6]. If he does not offer a reason in the
condemnation itself, however, he ought to offer a
reason for that condemnation in other assertions of his.

De generalibus conciliis condentibus symbola
respondetur quod licet in ipsis symbolis non probent
per regulam fidei articulos simbolorum, tamen extra
ipsa simbola manifeste probantur quia vel condentes
symbola ipsos articulos probant vel probationes
approbant aliorum tacite vel expresse.

To the question of general councils composing creeds,
the response is that although in the creeds themselves
they may not prove the articles of the creeds by the
rule of faith, they are nonetheless clearly proved
outside those creeds because either those who
compose the creeds prove the articles or they approve
tacitly or expressly the proofs of others.

Discipulus Quid si aliquis defenderet coram papa
haeresim quam diceret se putare consonam esse fidei
catholicae?

Disciple What if someone were to defend a heresy
before the pope and were to say that he thinks that it is
consistent with catholic faith?
