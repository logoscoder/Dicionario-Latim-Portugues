divulgatam. Ergo quicunque negat talem assertionem
est tanquam pertinax et haereticus iudicandus.

among all catholics; whoever, therefore, denies such
an assertion should be judged as pertinacious and a
heretic.

Maior ex descriptione pertinacis patet, quia "pertinax
est qui persistit in hoc quod debet dimittere". Talis
autem est qui negat assertionem catholicam quam
tenetur explicite credere, quia ex quo tenetur eam
explicite credere tenetur negationem eiusdem dimittere;
ergo si negat est pertinax.

The major [premise] is clear from the description of
pertinacious, because "he is pertinacious who persists
in that which he should put aside". [See chapter 1] He
who denies a catholic assertion which he is bound
explicitly to believe, however, is such a person,
because from the fact that he is bound explicitly to
believe it he is bound to put aside its denial; if he does
deny it, therefore, he is pertinacious.

Minor probatur, quia si aliquis tenetur aliquam
assertionem catholicam explicite credere, aut ad hoc
tenetur quia talis assertio est apud omnes catholicos
tanquam catholica divulgata, aut quia sibi patenter
ostenditur per Scripturam Divinam vel doctrinam vel
determinationem universalis ecclesiae quod catholica
est censenda. Si detur primum, habetur intentum, quod
quilibet Christianus tenetur explicite credere omnem
assertionem catholicam quam scit apud omnes
catholicos esse pro catholica divulgatam. Quod si dicat
se hoc ignorare oportet eum, si debet apud ecclesiam
excusari, hoc probare. Secundum dari non potest, quia
tunc nullus teneretur credere explicite Christum natum
de virgine vel fuisse crucifixum nec aliquem alium
articulum fidei, antequam sibi per Scripturam Divinam
probaretur. Et ita quilibet laicus posset impune negare
omnem articulum fidei quousque sibi per librum
ostenderetur talem articulum in Biblia contineri.
Confirmatur haec ratio, quia qui negat fidem
Christianam esse veram vel sectam Sarracenorum esse
falsam et malam est statim pertinax et haereticus
iudicandus. Sed hoc non est nisi quia apud omnes
catholicos divulgatur tanquam catholicum quod fides
Christiana est vera fides et quod fides Sarracenorum est
falsa fides. Ergo per eandem rationem qui negat
quamcunque assertionem catholicam apud omnes
catholicos divulgatam est statim pertinax et haereticus
reputandus, nec potest apud ecclesiam aliqualiter
excusari nisi probet se ignorasse assertionem negatam
esse taliter divulgatam.

The minor [premise] is proved because if anyone is
bound explicitly to believe some catholic assertion, he
is so bound either (a) because such an assertion has
been published among all catholics as catholic or (b)
because it is clearly shown to him by divine scripture
or by the teaching or determination of the universal
church that it should be considered catholic. If the
first (a) is granted, the point is won because every
christian is bound explicitly to believe every catholic
assertion that he knows has been published as catholic
among all catholics - if he says that he does not know
[that it has been so published] he must prove this, if
he ought to be excused by the church. The second (b)
can not be granted because then no one would be
bound explicitly to believe that Christ was born of a
virgin or had been crucified or any other article of
faith before it was proved to him from divine
scripture. And so any layman could with impunity
deny every article of faith until it was shown to him in
the book that such an article is contained in the bible.
This argument is confirmed because anyone who
denies that the christian faith is true or that the sect of
the Saracens is false and bad should be judged
immediately to be pertinacious and a heretic; but this
is so only because it is published among all catholics
as catholic that the christian faith is the true faith and
the faith of the Saracens a false faith; by the same
argument, therefore, he who denies any assertion
published among all catholics as catholic should be
regarded immediately as pertinacious and a heretic
and can not be excused by the church in any way
unless he proves that he had not known that the
assertion he denies was published in this way.

Master If it is not known of someone denying
catholic truth whether he is ready to be corrected by
the rule of faith, that is by sacred scripture, he should
not be judged to be pertinacious. This is quite clear
from the text of Augustine cited above and found at
24. q. 3. Dixit apostolus [col. 998]. Hence the gloss
