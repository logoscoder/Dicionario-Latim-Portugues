Hebraei fuit expressa in Veteri Testamento; ergo et tota
fides ad quam de necessitate salutis christiani artantur
in Novo Testamento et veteri continetur. Ergo
christianus de necessitate salutis non tenetur credere
aliquid quod nec in biblia continetur nec ex solis
contentis in biblia potest consequentia necessaria et
manifesta inferri.

Hebrews were bound was expressed in the Old
Testament; it is also the case therefore that the whole
faith to which christians are bound out of necessity for
salvation is contained in the New and Old Testament.
Therefore a christian is not bound out of necessity for
salvation to believe anything which neither is
contained in the bible nor can be inferred as a
necessary and clear consequence solely from things
contained in the bible.

Tertio sic. Illud quod eadem facilitate contemnitur qua
probatur ad fidem catholicam minime spectat, et esto
quod sit verum non debet inter veritates catholicas
numerari; sed secundum beatum Hieronymum de
Scripturis Divinis loquentem, quod de scripturis
auctoritatem non habet eadem facilitate contemnitur
qua probatur; ergo nulla veritas quae ex Scripturis
Divinis auctoritatem non habet est inter veritates
catholicas computanda.

A third [argument] is as follows. That which is
condemned with the same readiness with which it is
approved does not pertain to catholic faith and, even if
it is true, should not be counted among catholic truths;
but according to blessed Jerome, speaking about the
divine scriptures, what does not have authority from
those scriptures is condemned with the same readiness
with which it is approved; therefore no truth which
does not have authority from the divine scriptures
should be counted among catholic truths.

A second opinion: There are Catholic truths not found in the Bible
Magister Sed alii isti sententiae nequaquam
consentiunt dicentes quod multae sunt veritates
catholicae et fidem sapientes catholicam quae nec in
Divinis Scripturis habentur divinis explicite nec ex
solis contentis in eis possunt inferri quibus tamen
fidem indubiam explicitam vel implicitam adhibere est
necessarium ad salutem.

Master But others do not agree with that opinion,
saying that there are many catholic truths and some
smacking of catholic faith which neither are found
explicitly in the divine scriptures nor can be inferred
solely from what is contained in them, towards which
it is nevertheless necessary for salvation to exercise
undoubting faith, either explicit or implicit.

Ad cuius evidentiam dicunt esse sciendum quod
praeter veritates circa quas licitum est sic et aliter
opinari veritates quas quilibet catholicus certa
credulitate explicite vel implicite tenere astringitur
possunt in triplici differentia reperiri.

To make this clear they say that it ought to be known
that besides the truths about which it is permissible to
hold opinions one way or the other, the truths which
any catholic at all is bound to hold explicitly or
implicitly with sure belief can be found in threefold
diversity.

Quaedam enim sunt de Deo et Christo secundum
humanitatem ex quibus principaliter salus nostra
dependet, sicut quod unus est Deus et tres sunt
personae, quod Christus est verus Deus et verus homo,
passus mortuus et quod resurrexit et ascendit, etc.

[1] For some, on which our salvation principally
depends, concern God and Christ in his humanity,
such as that there is one God and three persons, that
Christ is true God and true man, [that] he suffered and
died, that he rose and ascended, etc.

Aliae sunt veritates ex quibus non ita principaliter
dependet salus humana, eas tamen oportet firma fide
tenere, quia ex revelatione vel approbatione Dei, cui
nullus debet catholicus dissentire, ad orthodoxorum
notitiam pervenerunt, quibus mediantibus ipsas fideles
posteri susceperunt. Huiusmodi veritates sunt
quammplures in canone confirmato contentae in quo
etiam multae habentur de creaturis et etiam de
infidelibus hominibus, quae non directe sed indirecte
quodammodo ad salutem humani generis pertinere

[2] There are other truths on which human salvation
does not principally depend in this way, yet which it is
necessary to hold with sure faith because by the
revelation or approval of God, from whom no catholic
ought to dissent, they came to the knowledge of the
orthodox, through whose mediation later believers
received them. There are very many truths of this kind
contained within the established canon, in which there
are also many found about creatures, and even about
unbelieving people, which are known to pertain to
