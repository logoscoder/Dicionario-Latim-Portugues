Magister Tenent isti quod quinque sunt genera
veritatum quibus non licet christianis aliqualiter
dissentire. Primum est earum quae in Scriptura Sacra
traduntur vel ex eis argumento necessario possunt
inferri. Secundum est earum quae ab apostolis ad nos
per succedentium relationem vel scripturas fidelium
pervenerunt, licet in Scripturis Sacris non inveniantur
insertae nec ex solis eis possint necessario argumento
concludi. Tertium est earum quas in fide dignis
cronicis et historiis vel relationibus fidelium
invenimus. Quartum est earum quae ex veritatibus
primi generis et secundi tantummodo vel ex eis vel
alterius earum una cum veritatibus tertii generis
possunt manifeste concludi. Quintum est earum quas
Deus praeter veritates revelatas apostolis aliis revelavit
vel etiam inspiravit aut noviter revelaret vel etiam
inspiraret, quae revelatio vel inspiratio ad universalem
ecclesiam absque dubitatione pervenit vel etiam
perveniret.

Master They hold that there are five kinds of truth
from which christians are not permitted to dissent in
any way. The first is those which are handed down in
sacred scripture or can be inferred from them by
necessary argument. The second is those which have
come to us from the apostles through the report of
those who succeeded them or through the writings of
the faithful, even if they may not be found included in
the sacred scriptures and can not be inferred from
them alone by necessary argument. The third is those
which we find in chronicles or histories or the
accounts of believers which are worthy of trust. The
fourth is those which can be clearly inferred from
truths of the first and second kind alone or from them
or one or other of them together with truths of the
third kind. The fifth is those which, in addition to the
truths revealed to the apostles, God revealed to or,
also, inspired in others or would newly reveal or even
inspire, a revelation or inspiration which has come or,
also, would come to the universal church without any
doubt.

Discipulus Quamvis non intenderim de istis te amplius
molestare, quia tamen unum genus veritatum de quibus
nullus dubitat catholicus omisisti edissere quare isti
inter alias veritates illas quae in decretalibus et
diffinitionibus ecclesiae reperiuntur nequaquam
enumerant?

Student Although I did not intend to trouble you
further about these matters, nevertheless because you
omitted one kind of truth about which no catholic has
doubts, set down why they do not count among other
truths those which are found in the decretals and
definitions of the church?

Magister Ideo de illis veritatibus mentionem non
faciunt specialem quia putant quod ecclesia rite
procedens nullam veritatem determinat aut diffinit nisi
in Scriptura Sacra aut traditionibus apostolorum aut
cronicis, historiis, vel revelationibus indubitabilibus
fidelium vel in his quae sequuntur ex praedictis aut
aliquo praedictorum vel in revelatione seu inspiratione
divina modo debito manifestata valeat se fundare. Et
ideo omnes veritates quas determinat aut diffinit
ecclesia sub aliquo quinque generum praefatorum
comprehendi noscuntur.

Master They do not make particular mention of those
truths for this reason, that they think that when the
church proceeds correctly it determines or defines no
truth unless it can base itself on sacred scripture, on
the traditions of the apostles, on indubitable
chronicles, histories or revelations of believers, or on
those things which follow from these or any one of
them, or on divine revelation or inspiration manifested
in the due way. And all the truths that the church
determines or defines, therefore, are known to be
included under some of the above five kinds.

Discipulus Illa quae refers urgent me contra
propositum praeconceptum interrogare. Quid de
approbatione canonis bibliae et aliorum librorum
postea conscriptorum ac omnium aliorum quae ecclesia
noscitur approbare assertores sentiunt memorati?

Student What you are reporting urges me to ask
questions about the above proposition. What do those
who affirm the above position think about the
approval of the canon of the bible, of other books
composed later and of all the others which the church
is known to approve?

Magister Hoc pro certissimo tenent quod non est in
potestate ecclesiae quaecunque ad placitum approbare
vel etiam improbare, sed ecclesia rite approbando
quaecunque in aliquo praedictorum quinque generum
veritatum se fundavit. Unde et approbationem quantum
ad rem, licet quantum ad nomen, a determinatione vel
diffinitione in proposito non discernunt.

Master They hold this as quite certain, that it is not in
the power of the church to approve or also to reject
anything at all as it pleases, but when the church has
approved anything correctly it has based itself on
some of the above five kinds of truth. Hence also in
the present case they do not make any real distinction,
although there is a nominal distinction, between
approval on the one hand or determination or
definition on the other.
