beatus Hilarius episcopus Pictaviensis. De isto tamen
sunt opiniones, quibusdam dicentibus quod numquam
fuit verus papa sed papatus invasor, aliis dicentibus
quod fuit verus papa antequam in heresim laberetur.

is brought forth concerning Leo whom blessed Hilary,
bishop of Poitiers, convicted of error. There are
opinions about him, nevertheless, with some people
saying that he was never a true pope but only a
usurper of the papacy and others saying that he was a
true pope before he slipped into heresy.

Septimum exemplum ad probandum quod papa potest
hereticari ponitur de Sylvestro II de quo legitur quod
diabolo fecit homagium; quem eciam in papatu
existens consuluit; ex quo arguunt quod potuit
hereticari, quia omnis demonum invocator et cultor
habensque cum demoniis societatem pestiferam potest
hereticam incurrere pravitatem.

A seventh example cited to prove that a pope can
become a heretic concerns Sylvester II of whom we
read that he did homage to the devil and also
consulted him when he was actually pope; they affirm
from this that hewas able to become a heretic because
anyone who invokes or worships demons and keeps
pestilential company with them is able to incur
heretical wickedness.

Octavum exemplum est de pluribus summis
pontificibus tenentibus circa ea que fidei sunt
asserciones contrarias, videlicet de Iohanne 22 ex parte
una, et de Nicolao 3 aliisque quampluribus ex alia parte
qui de paupertate Christi et apostolorum eius
concordem sentenciam diffinierunt vel approbaverunt
ab aliis diffinitam; quam sentenciam predictus
Iohannes 22 reprobat manifeste. Ex quo infertur quod
vel Iohannes 22 vel Nicolaus 3 ex quo alter eorum
erravit in fide fuit hereticus reputandus. Nam ille
eorum qui erravit suum errorem diffiniendo solenniter
aliosque ad tenendum artando pertinaciter suo errori
adhesit; ergo alter eorum est hereticus iudicandus.

The eighth example concerns several highest pontiffs
maintaining opposed assertions about matters
concerning faith, that is John XXII on the one hand
and Nicholas III and very many others on the other
hand, who defined an agreed opinion on the poverty
of Christ and his apostles or approved one defined by
others, an opinion which the aforesaid John XXII
clearly rejects. We infer from this that because one of
them erred in the faith, either John XXII or Nicholas
III should be regarded as a heretic. For whichever of
them erred by defining his error solemnly and
constraining others to hold it adhered to his error
pertinaciously; therefore one of them should be
adjudged a heretic.

Item ponunt exemplum de Innocencio 3 et eodem
Iohanne 22, quod alter eorum erravit in fide. Nam
Innocencius 3, sicut legitur Extra, De celebracione
missarum c. Cum Marthe, ponit et asserit manifeste
quod sancti in celo sunt perfecte beati et quod omnia
eis ad vota succedunt et per consequens vident Deum.
Item in libro De contemptu mundi idem Innocencius
dogmatizat quod anime reproborum sunt nunc in
inferno ubi graviter puniuntur. Iohannes autem 22
docet et predicat quod anime sanctorum non vident
Deum et quod anime reproborum non sunt in inferno
nec ante diem generalis iudicii punientur. Cum ergo
contradictorie simul esse vere non possint, constat
quod alter istorum erravit et ita liquet aperte quod papa
potest errare.

Again, they cite the example of Innocent III and the
same John XXII, one of whom erred in the faith. For
as we read in Extra, De celebracione missarum, c.
Cum Marthe [col.636], Innocent III states and asserts
clearly that the saints in heaven are perfectly blessed,
that everything prospers for them according to their
wishes and that, as a consequence, they see God.
Again, in his book, De contemptu mundi, Innocent
propounds as dogma that the souls of the condemned
are now in hell where they are being severely
punished. John XXII teaches and preaches, however,
that the souls of the saints do not see God and that the
souls of the condemned are not in hell and will not be
punished before the day of general judgement. Since
contradictory propositions can not be true at the same
time, it is therefore certain that one of them has erred,
and so it is quite clear that a pope can err.

Item ponitur exemplum de isto Iohanne 22 et de beato
Gregorio. Nam, sicut ex libro Dialogorum beati
Gregorii claret, ipse sensit quod anime sanctorum in
celo vident Deum et quod anime reproborum puniuntur
in inferno. Iohannes autem 22 negat utrunque; ergo
alter eorum erravit.

Next the example of John XXII and blessed Gregory
is cited. For as is clear from his book, Dialogues,
blessed Gregory believed that the souls of the saints in
heaven see God and that the souls of the condemned
are being punished in hell. Because John XXII denies
both these [statements], one of them has erred.

Item ponunt exemplum de eodem Iohanne 22 et multis

Then they give the example of John XXII and many
