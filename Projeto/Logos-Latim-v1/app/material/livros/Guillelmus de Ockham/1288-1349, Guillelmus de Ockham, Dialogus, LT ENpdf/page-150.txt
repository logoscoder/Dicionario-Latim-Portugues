Magister De pertinacia et haeretica pravitate ille
convincitur necessario qui abiurat catholicam
veritatem vel iurat se quamcunque assertionem quae
est in rei veritate haeretica tanquam catholicam in
perpetuum servaturum. Quod enim omnis talis sit
pertinax et haereticus reputandus tali ratione
ostenditur. Qui firmat se in proposito negandi
assertionem quae est catholica vel tenendi assertionem
quae est haeretica pertinax est censendus. Talis autem
est ille qui abiurat veritatem quae est catholica vel
iurat se servaturum assertionem quae est haeretica.
Ergo pertinax est censendus.

Master That person is necessarily convicted of
pertinacity and heretical wickedness [tenth way] who
abjures a catholic truth or swears that he will forever
preserve as catholic any assertion which in truth of
fact is heretical. For it is shown by the following
argument that such a person should be regarded as
pertinacious and a heretic. He who declares that he
intends to deny an assertion which is catholic or to
hold an assertion which is heretical should be
considered pertinacious; he who abjures a truth which
is catholic or swears that he will preserve an assertion
which is heretical, however, is a person of this kind; he
should, therefore, be considered pertinacious.

Item errans contra fidem catholicam qui non est
paratus corrigi pertinax et hereticus est censendus.
Huiusmodi autem abiurans catholicam veritatem et qui
iurat se heresim defensurum vel quod assertioni que
est heretica adhaerebit nec est paratus corrigi. Ergo
pertinax et haereticus est censendus.

Again, someone who errs against the catholic faith and
is not ready to be corrected should be considered
pertinacious and a heretic; he who abjures a catholic
truth, however, and he who swears he will defend a
heresy or will cling to an assertion which is heretical is
like this, and is not ready to be corrected; therefore he
should be considered pertinacious and a heretic.

Discipulus Nonne potest talis aliquo modo de
pertinacia excusari?

Student Is there some way a person like this can be
excused of pertinacity?

Magister Respondetur quod metu mortis vel gravium
tormentorum potest a pertinacia et pravitate haeretica
excusari, sed non a peccato mortali.

Master The answer is that because of the fear of death
or of severe torture he can be excused of pertinacity
and heretical wickedness, but not of a mortal sin.

Discipulus Videtur quod ignorantia talem poterit
excusare. Ignorantia enim excusat a mendacio illum
qui dicit falsum quod putat esse verum, ut Augustinus
asserit, prout habetur 22, q. 2, c.Is autem. Ergo
consimiliter ignorantia poterit excusare illum qui
abiurat veritatem catholicam quam putat haereticam et
illum qui iurat se tenere assertionem haereticam quam
putat catholicam.

Student It seems that ignorance will be able to excuse
such a person. For ignorance excuses of lying
someone who says something which is false but which
he thinks is true, as Augustine asserts, as we find in
22, q. 2, c. Is autem [col.867]. In a similar way,
therefore, ignorance will be able to excuse someone
who abjures a catholic truth which he thinks is
heretical and someone who swears that he holds an
assertion which is heretical but which he thinks is
catholic.

Magister Respondetur tibi quod potest excusari
aliquis a mendacio qui tamen a temeritate nullatenus
excusatur, teste Augustino qui, ubi allegas, ait, "Nemo
mentiens iudicandus est qui dicit falsum quod putat
verum, quia, quantum in ipso est, non fallit ipse sed
fallitur. Non itaque mendacii sed aliquando temeritatis
arguendus est qui falsa incaute credit ac pro veris
habet." Sic abiurans et similiter iurans modo praedicto
a mendacio poterit excusari sed a temeritate minime
excusatur. Et ideo nec a pertinacia poterit excusari.
Potest enim pertinacia absque mendacio reperiri, sicut
in his qui sunt nescienter haeretici reperitur. Tales
enim cum putent esse vera quae dicunt minime
mentiuntur et tamen pertinaces censentur quia
nequaquam corrigi sunt parati.

Master The answer to you is that someone can be
excused of lying, without, nevertheless, being excused
of rashness. Augustine attests to this when he says, in
the place you just cited (22, q. 2, c. Is autem), "No one
should be judged a liar who says something which is
false but which he thinks is true, because as far as in
him lies he does not deceive but is himself deceived.
And so someone who incautiously believe falsehoods
and holds them to be true should not be accused of
lying but, sometimes, of rashness." [vol.1, col.868]
Likewise someone abjuring and also someone
swearing, in the way just described, can be excused of
lying but is not excused of rashness. Nor, therefore,
can he be excused of pertinacity. For pertinacity can
be found without lying, as it is found in those who are
unknowingly heretics. For since such people think that
what they are saying is true they are not lying, and yet
