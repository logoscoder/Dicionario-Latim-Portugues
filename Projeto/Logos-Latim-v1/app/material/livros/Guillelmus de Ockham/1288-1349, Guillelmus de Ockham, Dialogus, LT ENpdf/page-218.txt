Istas autem duas asserciones simul quidam sic nituntur
probare. Constantinus imperator constituit ut Romanus
pontifex esset caput omnium ecclesiarum; ergo Romana
ecclesia a Constantino et non ante super alias ecclesias
habuit principatum. Antecedens probatur per id quod
legitur in decretis dist. 96 et accipitur ex gestis beati
Silvestri, ubi sic habetur, "Constantinus imperator quarto
die sui baptismatis privilegium Romane ecclesie
pontifici contulit ut in toto orbe Romano pontifices vel
sacerdotes ita hunc caput habeant sicut iudices regem."
Et infra, "Et sicut nostram terrenam imperialem
potenciam ita eius sacrosanctam Romanam ecclesiam
decrevimus veneranter honorari et amplius quam
nostrum Imperium terrenumque tronum sedem
sacratissimam beati Petri gloriose exaltari, tribuentes ei
potestatem et gloriam et dignitatem atque vigorem et
honorificenciam
imperialem. Atque decernentes
sancimus ut principatum teneat tam super quatuor sedes
Alexandrinam, Anciochenam, Hierosolymitanam et
Constantinopolitanam quam eciam super omnes in
universo orbe terrarum Dei ecclesias. Et pontifex qui pro
tempore ipsius sacrosancte Romane ecclesie extiterit
celsior et princeps cunctis sacerdotibus et tocius mundi
existat et eius iudicio que ad cultum Dei vel fidem
Christianorum et stabilitatem procurandam firmiter
disponantur". Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi ut videtur
quod Romana ecclesia non nisi a Constantino super alias
ecclesias obtinuit principatum.

Now some of them try to prove those two assertions
at the same time as follows. The emperor
Constantine established the Roman pontiff as head
of all churches. It was from Constantine, therefore,
and not earlier, that the Roman church had dominion
over other churches. The antecedent is proved by
what we read in the decretals at dist. 96, [c. 14;
col.342], taken from the deeds of the blessed
Sylvester, where we find the following, "On the
fourth day after his baptism the emperor Constantine
conferred a privilege on the pontiff of the Roman
church that throughout the whole Roman world
pontiffs or priests would have him as their head in
the same way as judges have the king. ... And we
have decreed that his sacrosanct Roman church be
reverently honoured just like our earthly imperial
power and that the most sacred see of blessed Peter
be more gloriously exalted than our empire and
earthly throne, bestowing on it power, glory,
dignity, vigour and imperial honour. And we
establish by decree that it hold dominion both over
the four sees of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem and
Constantinople and also over all the churches of
God throughout all the lands of the earth. And let
whoever is pontiff of that sacrosanct Roman church
at any time be higher than and chief of all the priests
throughout the whole world and let whatever has to
be managed for the worship of God or for the faith
and stability of Christians be firmly regulated
according to his judgement." We are given to
understand by these words, it seems, that the Roman
church acquired dominion over other churches only
from Constantine.

Discipulus Ista assercio de primatu Romane ecclesie
michi non placet. Ideo assercionem contrariam
allegacionibus fulcire conare?

Student: [See Significant Variants, para. 33.]That
assertion about the primacy of the Roman church
does not please me. Would you therefore try to
support the opposing assertion with arguments.

The Roman Church had primacy before Constantine
Magister Tribus modis ponitur quod Romana ecclesia
ante tempora Constantini super alias omnes ecclesias
habuit principatum. Primus modus est quod habuit
principatum auctoritate conciliorum generalium. Unde in
decretis sic legitur dist. 17, para. Hinc eciam, "Scientes
quod eius sedi primum beati Petri apostoli meritum,
deinde,
secuta
iussione
Domini,
conciliorum
venerandorum auctoritas singularem in ecclesiis tradidit
potestatem." Ex quibus verbis habetur quod veneranda
concilia tradiderunt sedi beati Petri singularem super
ecclesias potestatem.

Master: That the Roman church obtained dominion
over all other churches before the time of
Constantine is put in three ways. The first way is
that it obtained dominion on the authority of general
councils. So we read as follows in the decretals at
dist. 17, para. Hinc etiam [col.52], "We know that
first the merit of the apostle blessed Peter then,
following the Lord's order, the authority of
venerable councils handed unique power over the
churches to his see." We find from these words that
venerable councils handed unique power over the
churches to the see of blessed Peter.
