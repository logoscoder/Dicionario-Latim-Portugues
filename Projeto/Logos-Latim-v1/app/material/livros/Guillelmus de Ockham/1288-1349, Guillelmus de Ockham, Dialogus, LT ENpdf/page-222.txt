civitatem.

see from Rome to another city.

Magister Ad hoc quidam dicunt eorum quod bene posset
fieri auctoritate summi pontificis. Quorum racio est quia
papa respectu sedis apostolice est tante potestatis quante
fuit beatus Petrus. Sicut ergo beatus Petrus causa
utilitatis transtulit sedem suam de una civitate ad aliam,
ita posset papa sedem papalem de Roma transferre ad
aliam civitatem.

Master: Some of them reply to this that it could
indeed be done by the authority of the highest
pontiff. Their argument is that the pope has as much
power with respect to the apostolic see as blessed
Peter had. Just as blessed Peter transferred his see
from one city to another for the sake of usefulness,
therefore, so the pope could transfer the papal see
from Rome to another city.

Discipulus Nunquid secundum istos esset concedendum,
si papa transferret sedem Parisius, quod ecclesia
Parisiensis
voce
evangelica
Domini
obtinuit
principatum?

Student: If the pope were to transfer his see to
Paris, would it be granted by them that the church of
Paris obtained dominion by the word of the Lord in
the gospels?

Magister Dicerent quod sic, quia sicut modo dicunt de
Romana ecclesia quod voce evangelica Domini obtinuit
principatum propter hoc quod Dominus ante
ascensionem suam, secundum quod evangelista testatur,
beato Petro contulit principatum, cui eciam dedit
potestatem preficiendi quamcumque ecclesiam in qua
sibi sedem eligeret ecclesiis universis, ita ecclesia
Parisienis diceretur obtinuisse super alias ecclesias voce
evangelica Domini principatum, quia Dominus ante
ascensionem suam cuilibet successori beati Petri in ipso
Petro dedit potestatem quamcumque ecclesiam
preficiendi ecclesiis aliis universis.

Master: They would say 'yes', because just as they
say now of the Roman church that it obtained
dominion by the word of the Lord in the gospel
because of the fact that before his ascension the
Lord conferred dominion on blessed Peter,
according to the testimony of the evangelist, and
also gave him power to place any church which he
chose for his see in authority over all churches, so
the church of Paris would be said to have obtained
dominion over other churches by the word of the
Lord in the gospel, because before his ascension the
Lord gave power in the person of Peter to every
successor of blessed Peter to place any church at all
in authority over all other churches.

Discipulus Tenent omnes isti quod papa posset
transferre sedem de Roma?

Student: Do they all maintain that the pope could
transfer his see from Rome?

Magister Multi eorum affirmant quod papa non posset,
quia Petrus non auctoritate propria sed iubente Domino
sedem transtulit de Anciochia Romam, et ideo papa non
posset transferre eandem sedem de Roma nisi Dominus
ipse iuberet.

Master: Many of them assert that he could not do so
because Peter transferred his see from Antioch to
Rome not on his own authority but at the command
of the Lord, and so the pope could not transfer that
see from Rome unless the Lord himself were to
command it.

Discipulus Dic aliam responsionem ad obieccionem qua
ostenditur quod ecclesia Hierosolymitana super omnes
alias ecclesias quatuor annis habuit principatum.

Student: Tell me another reply to the objection by
which it is shown that the Jerusalem church had
dominion over all other churches for four years.

Magister Alia responsio est quod verum est ecclesiam
Hierosolymitanam tanto tempore habuisse super omnes
alias ecclesias principatum eo quod tot annis ibidem
sedit beatus Petrus.

Master: Another reply is that it is true that the
Jerusalem church had dominion over all other
churches for so long because blessed Peter had his
see there for so many years.
