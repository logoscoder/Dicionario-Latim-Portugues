veritatem "Beatus Andreas fuit apostolus Christi"
contineri vel posse inferri ex Scriptura Divina. Quo
posito, si pertinaciter adhaeret quacunque ex causa huic,
"Beatus Andreas non fuit apostolus Christi", non
catholicus
sed
haereticus
est
iudicandus,
quantumcunque firmiter teneat hanc universalem,
"Omnia quae docet Scriptura Divina sunt catholica et
vera".

Catholic and true", and yet believe it to be false that
"Blessed Andrew was an apostle of Christ", because he
does not know that the truth "Blessed Andrew was an
apostle of Christ" is contained in or can be inferred
from divine scripture. Assuming that this is so, if he
adheres pertinaciously, for whatever reason, to the
statement that "Blessed Andrew was not an apostle of
Christ", he must be judged not a Catholic but a heretic,
however firmly he may hold the universal statement,
"All things that divine scripture teaches are Catholic
and true".

Capitulum 2

Chapter 2

Discipulus Nunc magis quam ante perpendo quod ad
cognoscendum quis est censendus catholicus oportet
scire quis sit inter hereticos computandus, et ideo de
haereticis volo aliqua perscrutari. Ne tamen per
aequivocationem decipiar, dic primo si hoc nomen
haereticus habeat significationem unam vel plures.

Disciple Now more than ever I consider that to know
who should be considered a Catholic one must know
who should be counted among the heretics, and
therefore I wish to examine some points concerning
heretics. But lest I be deceived through equivocation,
say first if the word heretic has one meaning or several.

Who should be regarded as a heretic?
Magister
Istius
nominis
haereticus
plures
significationes assignantur. Uno enim modo omnis
excommunicatus vocatur haereticus. Unde 4, q. 1, c. 2,
dicit Nicolaus papa: "'Haereticos autem' inquiunt
'dicimus tam eos qui ab ecclesia olim proiecti sunt
quam qui post hoc a nobis anathematizati sunt'". Et in
eodem capitulo notat glossa dicens: "Nota quod omnis
excommunicatus dicitur haereticus." Et hoc idem notat
glossa, 24, q. 1, para. Quia vero.

Master Several meanings of this word heretic are
assigned. In one way every excommunicate is called a
heretic. Thus in 4, q. 1, c. 2 [col. 537], Pope Nicholas
says: "'And we call heretics', they say, ' both those who
have formerly been expelled by the Church, and also
those who after this have been anathematized by us'".
And in the same chapter the gloss comments: "Note
that every excommunicate is called a heretic". And the
gloss notes the same on 24, q. 1, para. Quia vero.

Secundo
modo
dicitur
haereticus
perversor
sacramentorum. Et sic simoniacus dicitur haereticus.
Unde Gregorius, ut habetur 1, q. 1, c. Quisquis, ait:
"Quisquis per pecuniam ordinatur ad hoc quod fiat
haereticus promovetur".

In a second way a pervertor of the sacraments is called
a heretic. And thus a simoniac is called a heretic. Thus
Gregory (as we read in 1, q. 1, c. Quisquis) says:
"Anyone who is ordained through money is promoted
to this, that he may become a heretic".

Tertio modo dicitur haereticus quicunque dubitat vel
putat fidem Christianam esse falsam vel fictam. Et sic
omnes Iudaei, Sarraceni et Pagani sunt censendi
haeretici. Hinc dicit glossa, 24, q. 3, para. Quia vero:
"Quandoque large dicitur haereticus omnis qui non
tenet articulos fidei". Et secundum hoc Iudaeus et
Gentilis sunt haeretici, et secundum hoc non omnis
haereticus est excommunicatus. Isto etiam modo dubii
in fide sunt haeretici, quia sunt infideles, ut habetur
Extra, De haereticis, c. 1 [col. 778: "Dubius in fide
infidelis est"]. Sic etiam qui primo sunt Catholici et
postea reputant fidem christianam esse falsam sunt
haeretici, et sic qui apostotant ore et mente a fide sunt
censendi haeretici. Si quis autem apostotaret ore
tantummodo non esset apud Deum haereticus, quamvis
ecclesia ipsum deberet haereticum reputare nisi
constaret eum apostatasse timore mortis.

In a third way, whoever doubts or thinks that the
Christian faith is false or an invention is called a
heretic. And in this way all Jews, Saracens and pagans
should be considered heretics. Hence the gloss says, 24,
q. 3, para. Quia vero[col. 1427], "Sometimes anyone
who does not hold the articles of faith is, in a broad
sense, called a heretic". And according to this the Jew
and the Gentile are heretics, and according to this not
every heretic is excommunicate. In this way also those
doubtful in faith are heretics, because they are
unbelievers, as we read in Extra, De haeretics, c. 1.
Thus also those who are at first Catholics and
afterwards think that the Christian faith is false are
heretics, and thus those who apostatize from the faith
by mouth and mind are to be considered heretics. (But
if anyone apostatized only by mouth, he would not be a
heretic before God, though the Church would have to
regard him as a heretic unless it were certain that he
apostatized from fear of death.)

Quarto modo dicitur haereticus omnis Christianus, vel In a fourth way, every Christian, or one who thinks or
qui putat aut qui putaverit se Christianum, errans thought himself to be a Christian, who errs
