potest.

attest; therefore, a pope can not become a heretic.

Capitulum 5

Chapter 5

Discipulus Quamvis iste raciones videantur michi
difficiles tamen conclusioni nescio assentire. Unde
qualiter respondetur ad eas enarra.

Student: Although those arguments seem difficult to
me I can not agree with their conclusion. So would
you tell me how they may be replied to.

Replies to arguments that a pope cannot become a heretic
Magister Ad primam earum respondetur quod in illa
communitate que non est sibiipsi relicta sed est
preservata ab illo qui errare non potest, potest esse
iudicium certum de dubiis, licet quilibet de illa
communitate sigillatim possit errare, et hoc quia nullus
eorum specialiter preservatur quin possit errare sicut
communitas preservatur. Sic est de ecclesia militante,
quia quilibet in ecclesia militante in manu consilii sui
relinquitur ut secundum sue voluntatis arbitrium
manere possit in fide, gracia assistente divina, vel a
fide
catholica
deviare.
Communitas
autem
Christianorum sic preservatur a Deo quod si unus
exorbitaverit a fide alius firmus in fide divino munere
permanebit. Unde si papa contra fidem erraverit, alius
Christianus, vir vel mulier, minime a fide recedet.

Master: The reply to the first of them is that there can
be sure judgement about doubtful matters in that
community which has not been left to itself but has
been kept safe by someone who can not err, even if
any member at all of that community singly can err and that because none of them individually is kept
safe from being able to err as the community is kept
safe. It is thus with the church militant, because any
individual in the church militant is left to the power of
his own counsel, so that he can with the help of divine
grace remain in the faith or he can turn away from the
catholic faith, according to the judgement of his own
will. The community of Christians is kept safe in such
a way by God, however, that if one of them turns
away from faith another will by divine gift remain
strong in the faith. So if the pope errs against faith
there will be another Christian, man or woman, who
will not withdraw from faith.

Discipulus Nonne talis modus arguendi valet? Quilibet
Christianus potest errare contra fidem; ergo tota
Christianorum communitas potest errare contra fidem.

Student: Is such a mode of arguing valid? Any
Christian can err against faith; therefore the whole
community of Christians can err against faith.

Magister Talis modus arguendi, ut multi dicunt, non
valet sed est fallacia figure diccionis, quia sepe a
nomine quod non est collectivum ad nomen
collectivum est fallacia figure diccionis, sicut hic:
quilibet de populo potest sustentari uno pane in die,
ergo populus potest sustentari uno pane in die; et sicut
hic: utraque pars contradiccionis potest esse vera, ergo
contradiccio potest esse vera.

Master: Many people say that such a mode of arguing
is not valid but is a fallacy of a figure of speech,
because it is a common fallacy of a figure of speech
[to move] from a noun which is not collective to a
collective noun. One example is this: any one of the
people can be sustained by one piece of bread a day,
so the people can be sustained by one piece of bread a
day; and another is this: either part of a contradiction
can be true, so the contradiction can be true.

Discipulus Non placet michi quod circa racionalem
scienciam te diffundas, ideo refer quomodo ad raciones
alias respondetur.

Student: I am not happy that you are branching out to
the science of reasoning, so would you report how
reply can be made to the other arguments.

Magister Ad secundam racionem respondetur quod
quamvis cause fidei ad hereticum sint minime
deferende, ad illum tamen qui potest hereticus fieri,
antequam efficiatur hereticus, sunt cause fidei
deferende. Et ideo licet papa possit in pravitatem labi
hereticam antequam labatur sunt cause fidei deferende
ad ipsum; sed si hereticam incurrerit pravitatem extunc
non est ad ipsum questio fidei deferenda. Non ergo ad
istum qui errat sed qui potest errare contra fidem est

[See Significant Variants, para. 29.] Master: The
reply to the second argument is that although
questions of faith should not be brought to a heretic,
they should nevertheless be brought to someone who
can become a heretic before he becomes a heretic.
And therefore although a pope can fall into heretical
wickedness, questions of faith should be brought to
him before he so falls; but if he has incurred heretical
wickedness there should from then on be no question
