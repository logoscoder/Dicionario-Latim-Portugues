CHAPTER 16

Student Although we considered whether the
emperor is the regular judge of the highest
pontiff in book six of the first part of our
Dialogue, and in that place you tried with
many arguments to establish the opposed
opinions about this, let us nevertheless confer
here about this matter in order to stimulate
others, who will see this tract but perhaps will
not have the first part of this work, to
investigate carefully whether the emperor has
or can have any power over a pope already
established in his pontificate. Let us first
investigate, however, whether by reason of
his imperial dignity the emperor is the regular
judge of the pope on any occasion.

CAN THE EMPEROR HAVE POWER OVER A POPE IN OFFICE?
14.25.1 Is the Emperor ever the pope's regular judge?

Magister Circa hoc sunt diversae assertiones
{*trs. &MzNaPeRe} et adversae. {opinio add.
&Mz} Una est quod imperator ratione
imperatoriae dignitatis non est iudex ordinarius
in quocunque casu summi pontificis.
14.25.1.1

Master There are differing and opposed
assertions about this. One is that on no
occasion is the emperor the regular judge of
the highest pontiff by reason of his imperial
dignity.

Opinion 1: The Emperor is never the pope's regular judge by virtue of his imperial dignity

Discipulus Pro ista assertione allega.

Student Argue for that assertion.

Magister Pro ista assertione potest taliter
allegari. Si imperator inquantum imperator
{inquantum imperator om. &Pe} esset iudex
ordinarius papae aut esset suus iudex {*trs.
&MzNaPeRe} in causa ecclesiastica aut in
causa seculari. Non in {*causa add.
&NaMzPeRe} ecclesiastica, quia {*causa
ecclesiastica add. &NaMzPeRe} solum {*om.
&MzNaRe} ad iudicem ecclesiasticum
{*solummodo add. &MzNaRe} spectat. Ideo

Master It can be argued as follows for that
assertion. If the emperor were the regular
judge of the pope as emperor he would be his
judge either in an ecclesiastical case or in a
secular case. [He is judge] not in an
ecclesiastical case because an ecclesiastical
case belongs only to an ecclesiastical judge.
For it is called an ecclesiastical case because
it should be treated before an ecclesiastical
judge. Nor [is he judge] in a secular case
