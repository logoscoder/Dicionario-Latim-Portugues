Item Gelasius papa, ut habetur {*legitur
&NaMzPeRe} 9, {14 &Pe} q. 3, c. Ipsi {isti
&NaRe}, ait {*om. &NaRe} loquens de sede
Romana {*ait add. &NaRe}, "Ab ipsa vero
nunquam {nusquam &NaMzPeRe} prorsus

sancti {*scilicet &NaMzPeRe} canones, "ac

&NaMzPeRe} sententiamque eius

potius sequenda {sequentia &Pe} decreta
mandaverunt {mandaverint &Pe}."

Again, as we read in 9, q. 3, c. Ipsi [c.16,
col.611], Pope Gelasius speaking about the
Roman see says, "They," that is the canons,
"have decreed that on no occasion at all ought
there be an appeal from it, and as a result that
it is the judge of the whole church and does
not come under anyone's judgement; and they
have commanded that there be no judgement
of its judgement and they have determined
that it is not appropriate that its sentence be
dissolved, rather they have ordered that its
decrees should be followed."

Again, we read the following in dist. 17, para.
Hinc etiam [c.6, col.52], "Nor has the bishop
of the afore-mentioned see," that is the
Roman see, "lain under the judgement of
inferiors. ... Indeed bishops sitting in a synod
gathered on the authority of that Symachus
said, `Pope Symachus, bishop of the apostolic
see, who has been assailed by opposition of
this kind, is exempt and free in respect of
men because we reserve all his cause to the
judgement of God."

Item Nicolaus papa, ut habetur {*legitur
&MzNaRe} 9, q. 3, c. Patet, ait, "Patet
profecto sedis apostolicae, cuius auctoritate
maius non est, iudicium a nemine fore

Again, as we read in 9, q. 3, c. Patet [c.10,
col.609], Pope Nicholas says, "It is certainly
true that the judgement of the apostolic see,
than whose authority there is none greater,
should not be revised by anyone, and no one
is permittted to judge its judgement. This is
according to what Pope Innocent, writing to
Rufus and the rest of the bishops appointed
throughout Thessalia, says, `No one has ever
