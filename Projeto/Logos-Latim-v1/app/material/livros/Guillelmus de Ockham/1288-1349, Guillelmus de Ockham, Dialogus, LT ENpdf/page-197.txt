permanserit, sed eciam dyocesanus loci in quo
moraretur papa haberet papam effectum hereticum
iudicare, et tunc negatur minor illius racionis quia, sicut
papa effectus hereticus est subiectus iudicio dyocesani
fidelis qui tamen potest errare, ita eciam papa effectus
hereticus est subiectus iudicio collegii cardinalium in
fide manencium, quod tamen potest hereticari, quo
hereticato non haberet de papa heretico iudicare; aut
papa incideret in heresim dampnatam solummodo
implicite, et tunc non collegium cardinalium sed
concilium generale haberet iudicare de ipso.

college of cardinals, if it has remained in the faith,
but also the diocesan of the place where the pope was
staying would have the power to judge a pope who
has become a heretic -- and then the minor [premise]
of that argument is denied, because just as a pope
who has become a heretic is subject to the judgement
of a believing diocesan, (who nevertheless himself
can err,) so also a pope who has become a heretic is
subject to the judgement of the college of the
cardinals who remain in faith, although if [the
college] were to become heretical, it would not have
the power to judge a heretical pope. [ii] Or the pope
would fall into a heresy which has only been
condemned implicitly and then it would not be the
college of cardinals but a general council that would
have the power to judge him.

Discipulus Quomodo potest aliquis qui potest errare de
papa heretico iudicare?

Student: How can someone who can err judge a
heretical pope?

Magister Respondetur quod sicut episcopi et
inquisitores heretice pravitatis, de quibus non est
dubium quin possint errare contra fidem, antequam in
hereticam inciderint pravitatem valent de hereticis
iudicare, ita et collegium cardinalium licet possit errare
contra fidem si tamen non erraverit sed in fide
permanserit orthodoxa potest de papa effecto heretico
iudicare.

[See Significant Variants, para. 32.]Master: It is
replied that just as bishops and inquisitors into
heretical wickedness, about whom there is no doubt
but that they can err against faith, can judge heretics,
before they themselves fall into heretical wickedness,
so also although the college of cardinals can err
against faith yet if it has not erred but remained in
orthodox faith it can judge a pope who has become a
heretic.

Discipulus Dic ad alias raciones.

Student: Speak to the other arguments.

Magister Ad quintam respondetur quod hereticato
collegio cardinalium non propter hoc hereticaretur tota
multitudo Christianorum. Quod autem dicitur de capite
languescente, etc. respondetur quod de multis membris
continet veritatem non tamen semper de omnibus
membris verificatur. Tempore enim Anastasii secundi
caput, scilicet Anastasius qui fuerat papa, languebat
heretica pravitate, et tamen multa membra sana et
integra remanebant.

Master: A reply to the fifth is that the college of
cardinals becoming heretical would not cause the
whole multitude of christians to become heretical. A
reply to what is said about the head becoming ill, etc.
is that it is true of many members, yet does not
always prove to be true of all members. For in the
time of Anastasius II the head, that is Anastasius who
was pope, was ill with heretical wickedness and yet
many members remained sound and whole.

Ad sextam racionem respondetur dupliciter: uno modo
concedendo quod nullum est collegium speciale, neque
prelatorum neque religiosorum neque clericorum neque
laicorum neque virorum neque mulierum, quod non
possit errare contra fidem, collegium tamen universale
Christianorum quod de facto comprehendit viros et
mulieres Deus numquam permittet contra fidem errare;
aliter dicitur quod preter collegium universale collegium
Romane dyocesis non potest errare contra fidem. Neque
valet consequencia: collegium cardinalium potest errare
contra fidem, ergo quodlibet aliud collegium particulare
potest errare contra fidem. Interdum enim aliqua
prerogativa competit toti que non est attribuenda parti,
et ideo licet secundum istos tota Romana dyocesis non
possit errare contra fidem tamen collegium cardinalium

There are two ways of replying to the sixth argument.
The first way is by granting that there is no particular
college, either of prelates, religious, clerics, laity,
men or women, which can not err against faith. Yet
God will never permit the universal college of
christians, which in fact is comprised of men and
women, to err against faith. In another way it is said
that apart from the universal college, the college of
the Roman diocese can not err against faith. And
[besides] the inference is not valid: 'the college of
cardinals can err against faith, therefore any other
particular college at all can err against faith.' For
sometimes some prerogative belongs to a whole
which should not be attributed to a part [of it] and so
although the whole Roman diocese can not err
