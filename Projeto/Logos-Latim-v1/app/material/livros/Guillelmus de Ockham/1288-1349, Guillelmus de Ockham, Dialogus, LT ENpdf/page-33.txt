iudicio absque omni temeritate culpare.

permissible for believers without any temerity to
condemn by means of a just judgement some things
inserted in the works of the saints and in his own
works.

Hoc etiam ratione moliuntur ostendere. Nam non est
necesse putare aliquid esse verum propter hoc quod illi
qui possunt errare hoc sentiunt. Nam propter solam
estimationem illorum qui possunt approbare falsum pro
vero non est eo ipso aliquid approbandum pro vero
quod tales sic sentiunt. Sed sancti stante sanctitate
possunt errare etiam contra catholicam veritatem. Ergo
propter hoc quod sancti aliquid sentiunt esse verum
non est necesse putare illud idem esse verum. Maior
est aperta; minor exemplo et ratione probatur.
Exemplo, inquam, de beato Augustino qui sanctus
existens plurima scripsit et docuit contra catholicam
veritatem quae et postmodum revocavit. Hoc etiam
ratione probatur. Nam error qui pertinaciam non habet
annexam non obviat sanctitati. Sed contingit aliquem
errare contra catholicam veritatem absque omni
pertinacia. Ergo non est inconveniens affirmare sanctos
stante sanctitate posse errare contra catholicam
veritatem; et ita non est necesse omnibus quae sancti
dicunt firmiter adhaerere.

They also try to show this by argument. For it is not
necessary to think that something is true because of
the fact that those who can err believe it. For just on
the basis of the opinion of those who can approve of
the false as true it is not for that reason necessary to
approve of something as true which they think to be
so. But saints can err even against catholic truth with
their sanctity unshaken. Because the saints think that
something is true, therefore, it is not necessary to
think that it is indeed true. The major [premise] is
clear; the minor is proved by example and by
argument. By the example, I say, of blessed Augustine
who, though a saint, wrote and taught many things
against catholic truth which he later retracted. This is
also proved by argument. For an error which is not
joined to pertinacity does not prevent sanctity. But it
is possible for someone to err against catholic truth
without any pertinacity. It is not irrational to affirm,
therefore, that with their sanctity unshaken saints can
err against catholic truth; and so it is not necessary to
adhere firmly to everything that the saints say.

Secunda conclusio quam isti tenent est quod nec etiam
omnibus sententiis que in sanctorum opusculis iam per
ecclesiam divulgatis reperiuntur est firmiter
adherendum, quod sic probare nituntur. Nemo debet
contrariis assentire; sed sancti in suis operibus iam per
ecclesiam divulgatis inter se inveniuntur contrarii
etiam in his quae ad fidem et doctrinam apostolicam
pertinere noscuntur. Nam ut habetur dist. 26 circa
doctrinam beati Pauli dicentis quod oportet episcopum
esse unius uxoris virum, id est non plurium,
Hieronymus et Augustinus sententias contrarias
protulerunt. Hinc est quod glossa dist. praedicta c. 1.
dicit, "Male sensit hic Hieronymus; unde Augustinus
eum corrigit in proximo capitulo."

[See Significant Variants, para. 4.] The second
conclusion they maintain is that not even all the
opinions which are found in the works of the saints
already published throughout the church should be
adhered to firmly, and this they try to prove as
follows. No one ought to assent to opposed [views],
but in their works already published by the church
saints are found to be opposed to each other, even in
those matters that are known to pertain to apostolic
faith and teaching. For as we find in dist. 26 [c.1 &
c.2; col.95] Jerome and Augustine proffered opposing
opinions about blessed Paul's teaching that it is proper
for a bishop to be the husband of one wife, that is not
of many [wives]. Hence the gloss on c. 1 of that
distinction [s.v. post baptismum; col.128] says,
"Jerome thought wrongly here and so Augustine
corrects him in the next chapter."

Isti etiam sancti, sicut patet in eorum epistolis et recitat
glossa ad Galatas 2, de reprehensione qua beatus
Paulus dicit beatum Petrum fuisse reprehensibilem
contraria sentiebant.

As is clear in their letters and is recorded in the gloss
on Galatians 2, those saints also had opposing
opinions about the reproof in which blessed Paul says
that blessed Peter was reprehensible.

Beatus etiam Cyprianus de baptismo haereticorum
aliter quam beatus Augustinus sensit. Unde et beatus
Augustinus eundem sanctum Cyprianum redarguit.
Loquens enim de sancto Cypriano et aliis, ut habetur
De consecratione dist. 4. c. Quomodo, ait, "Non ob
aliud visum est quibusdam etiam egregiis viris
antistibus Christi, inter quos praecipue beatus

In addition, blessed Cyprian thought differently from
blessed Augustine about the baptism of heretics, and
so blessed Augustine contradicted St. Cyprian. For
speaking about St. Cyprian and others he says, as we
find in De consecratione, dist. 4, c. Quomodo
[col.1377], "For no other reason has it seemed even to
some distinguished men, priests of Christ, among
