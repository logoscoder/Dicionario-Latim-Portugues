De praesumptionibus, super c. Literas notat dicens,
"Hoc est notabile quod semper standum est primo dicto
alicuius si postea contrarium dicat etiam in alio iudicio,
supra De testibus, Cum in tua et etiam extra iudicium,
supra De probationibus, Per tuas." Ex his aliisque
quampluribus patet quod qui invenitur sibi ipsi
contrarius non est credendum secundo dicto ipsius. Sed
qui negat catholicam veritatem quam prius putavit
catholicam invenitur sibi ipsi contrarius quia dum
putavit dictam veritatem esse catholicam dixit vel facto
aut verbo innuit se agnoscere illam veritatem esse
catholicam. Ergo si postea dicit se non agnovisse
dictam veritatem esse catholicam non est sibi
credendum. Et per consequens per hoc excusari non
potest quin sit modo pertinax et haereticus reputandus.

intolerable according to lawful decrees that what
anyone has clearly proclaimed in his own voice he
can in the same case invalidate by his own
testimony." And the gloss on [the word purgavit in]
the chapter Literas in Extra, De presumptionibus [col.
794] says, "It is noteworthy that we should always
stand by the first saying of someone if he later says
the opposite, even in another court, above [Extra], De
testibus, Cum in tua, and also outside court, above
Extra, De probationibus, Per tuas." [See Significant
Variants, para. 17.] It is clear from these and very
many others that what is said second by someone who
is found to contradict himself should not be believed.
But he who denies a catholic truth which he
previously thought to be catholic is found to
contradict himself because while he thought that the
said truth is catholic he said or implied by deed or
word that he knew that that truth is catholic. If he
later says, therefore, that he did not know that the said
truth is catholic he should not be believed and so he
can not be excused in this way but should be now
regarded as pertinacious and a heretic.

Quod autem non sit sibi credendum si dicat se paratum
corrigi ostenditur sic. Nulli erranti est credendum quod
paratus sit corrigi nisi quando praesumitur ignoranter a
veritate catholica deviare. Sed iste non praesumitur
ignoranter a veritate quae est catholica deviare, sed
praesumendum est de ipso quod a fundamento propter
quod assertioni priori adhaesit omnino recessit.
Fundamentum autem propter quod tali assertioni
adhaesit est Sacra Scriptura vel doctrina ecclesiae. Ergo
praesumendum est quod nunc reputat Scripturam
Sacram vel doctrinam ecclesiae esse falsam, sicut illi
qui primo propter doctrinam traditam in decretali
Nicolai 3 quae incipit Exiit qui seminat putaverunt et
tenuerunt ac docuerunt quod Christus et apostoli
omnem proprietatem temporalium abdicarunt et modo
tenent assertionem contrariam, reputantes doctrinam
traditam in decretali praedicta Exiit esse falsam. Et si
dicerent se putare eandem doctrinam esse veram non
esset eis credendum quia sibi ipsis contrarii
probarentur. Praesumendum est igitur quod negans
catholicam veritatem quam primo asseruit esse
catholicam nunc reputat Divinam Scripturam vel
doctrinam ecclesiae esse falsam. Tali autem non est
credendum quantumcunque dicat se paratum corrigi.
Ergo et neganti veritatem catholicam quam primo
habuit pro catholica non est credendum quamvis dicat
se paratum corrigi, et per consequens inter pertinaces et
haereticos est censendus. Et ita stant insolutae rationes
priores.

Moreover that he should not be believed if he says
that he is ready to be corrected is shown as follows.
Of no one erring should it be believed that he is ready
to be corrected unless it is presumed that he departs
ignorantly from catholic truth; but that person is not
presumed to depart ignorantly from truth which is
catholic; rather it should be presumed of him that he
has entirely abandoned the foundation on the basis of
which he clung to the earlier assertion; now the
foundation on the basis of which he clung to that
assertion is either sacred scripture or the teaching of
the church. It should be presumed, therefore, that he
now regards sacred scripture or the teaching of the
church as false, just like those who at first thought,
held and taught, on the basis of the teaching passed
down in the decretal of Nicholas III which begins
Exiit qui seminat, that Christ and the apostles
renounced all ownership of temporal goods, and now
hold the contrary assertion, regarding the teaching
handed down in that decretal Exiit as false. And if
they were to say that they think that that teaching is
true they should not be believed because they would
be proved to be contradicting themselves. It should be
presumed, therefore, that one denying a catholic truth
which he at first asserted to be catholic now regards
divine scripture or the teaching of the church as false.
Such a person, however, should not be believed
however much he says that he is ready to be
corrected; and one denying that a truth is catholic
which he at first held to be catholic, therefore, also
should not be believed even if he says that he is ready
to be corrected; and he should be considered, as a
consequence, among the pertinacious and the heretics.
And so the earlier arguments stand untouched.
