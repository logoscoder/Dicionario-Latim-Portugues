Can the pope make a new article of faith?
Discipulus Haec opinio multis prioribus assertionibus
quae videbantur mihi probabiles apparet omnino
repugnans. Ideo si in rationibus vel auctoritatibus
satagat se fundare declara.

Student This opinion seems completely contrary to
many earlier assertions which seemed probable to me.
Make clear, therefore, if it tries to base itself on
arguments or authorities.

Magister In duobus, ut audio, praedicti se fundant.
Primo in capitulo Alexandri 3 Extra, De haereticis,
Cum Christus ubi, ut dicunt, fecit novum articulum,
scilicet Christus est Deus et homo, quia ante tempora
Alexandri praedicti licebat, ut dicunt, non credere
Christum esse Deum et hominem. Secundo fundant se
in constitutione domini Iohannis Cum inter nonnullos
in qua diffinitur deinceps esse haereticum dicere
Christum et eius apostolos non habuisse aliquid nec in
speciali nec in communi, et per consequens antea non
fuit haereticum. Ex quibus sequitur quod papa potest
novos articulos fidei facere et potest facere quod
assertiones quae non fuerunt haereticae esse haereticae
de novo incipiant.

Master Those who hold it base themselves, as I hear,
on two [examples]. Firstly, [they base themselves] on
Alexander III's Chapter Cum Christus in Extra, De
haereticis [col.779] where, as they say, he made a
new article [of faith], namely that Christ is God and
man, because it was permissible before Alexander's
time, as they say, not to believe that Christ was God
and man. Secondly, they base themselves on Lord
John's constitution Cum inter nonnullos, in which it is
defined that hereafter it is heretical to say that Christ
and his apostles did not have anything either
individually or in common, and consequently it was
not heretical before. It follows from these that the
pope can make new articles of faith and can bring it
about that assertions which were not heretical begin to
be newly heretical.

Discipulus Exemplum adductum de constitutione
sanctissimi patris Iohannis papae 22 peto quod
nullatenus hic pertractes, quia, ut dixi, postea de tota
doctrina eiusdem quaestiones tibi movebo. Sed si pro
praedicta opinione aliquas rationes alias cogitasti
profer easdem.

Student I ask you not to investigate here the example
you brought forward from the constitution of the most
holy father, Pope John XXII, because later on, as I
have said, I will produce some questions for you
about all of his teaching. But if you have thought of
some other arguments for the aforesaid opinion put
them forward.

Magister Aliter potest opinio memorata muniri. Primo
sic: pro assertione haeresis est quis tanquam haereticus
condemnandus; sed multae fuerunt assertiones falsae
de quibus assertores earum, antequam fuerunt ab
ecclesia condemnatae, non fuerunt tanquam haeretici
condemnandi; postquam autem dictae assertiones
fuerunt ab ecclesia condemnatae, fuerunt assertores
earum tanquam haeretici condemnandi; ergo tales
assertiones ante damnationem ecclesiae non fuerunt
inter haereses computandae quae tamen post
damnationem pro haeresibus fuerunt habendae; et per
consequens eadem assertio quae primo non erat
haeresis per condemnationem ecclesiae haeresibus
numeratur. Quare eadem ratione eadem assertio quae
primo non est catholica postea per approbationem
ecclesiae fit catholica. Huiusmodi autem approbatio et
damnatio spectat ad summum pontificem; ergo
summus pontifex de assertione non catholica potest
facere catholicam, et de assertione non haeretica potest
facere haereticam; et ideo novum articulum fidei facere
potest.

Master That opinion can be fortified in other ways.
Firstly, as follows: anyone should be condemned as a
heretic for the assertion of a heresy; but there have
been many false assertions the affirmers of which
ought not to have been condemned as heretics before
[those assertions] were condemned by the church;
after the said assertions have been condemned by the
church, however, their affirmers should be condemned
as heretics; therefore such assertions, which after their
condemnation should be considered as heresies,
should not be reckoned among the heresies before
their condemnation by the church; and, consequently,
the same assertion which at first was not a heresy is
numbered among the heresies because of its
condemnation by the church. By the same argument,
therefore, the same assertion which at first is not
catholic, may later be catholic through the approval of
the church. Approval or condemnation of this kind,
however, pertains to the highest pontiff; therefore the
highest pontiff can make a catholic assertion of one
which is not catholic, and can make heretical an
assertion which is not heretical; and therefore he can
make a new article of faith.
