potestatis {*in add. &NaMzPeRe} hoc tertio

virtutes, dona Dei, sacramenta, iura
ecclesiastica et causae ecclesiasticae ac res ad
ecclesias {*ecclesiam &MzNaRe} pertinentes
et huiusmodi quae specialiter ad clericos
spectare dicuntur {dignoscuntur &Pe} sed et
{*etiam &NaPeRe} personae seu homines
inter spiritualia computantur, ideo de potestate
imperatoris super spiritualia quaesiturus a

imperator super aliquas personas spirituales

Student: I do not remember having read
explicitly in the divine scriptures that in
spiritual affairs all power has been denied
to the emperor, if he were catholic, and
therefore I propose to investigate in this
third book whether the emperor has some
power over spiritual matters or is capable of
power of this kind. Moreover, because not
only are grace, virtues, the gifts of God,
sacraments, ecclesiastical rights,
ecclesiastical causes, goods that belong to
the church and things of this kind which are
said to pertain especially to clerics reckoned
to be among spiritual matters, but also
persons or men, I will begin my inquiry
about the power of the emperor over
spiritual matters with spiritual persons. First
of all, however, I have considered that it
should be asked whether the emperor has
power over any spiritual persons.

DOES THE EMPEROR HAVE ANY POWER IN SPIRITUAL MATTERS?

DOES THE EMPEROR HAVE ANY POWER OVER SPIRITUAL PERSONS?

Magister Nonnullis apparet quod personae seu
{*sive &NaMzPeRe} homines possunt dici
spirituales dupliciter. Quidam enim dicuntur
spirituales quia secundum spiritum et legem
christianam {om. &Mz} quae lex spiritualis est
{quod add. &Mz} virtuose vivunt {trs. &Pe} et
de {*talibus add. &MzNaRe} spiritualibus sic

CHAPTER 1

Master: It seems to some that persons or
men can be called spiritual in two ways. For
some people are called spiritual because
they live virtuously according to the spirit
and christian law, which is the spiritual law,
and the apostle is talking about such
spiritual people when he says in 1 Cor.
