[c.21, col.240]).

Discipulus Omnino mihi videtur quod si
imperium est a papa et imperator debet
praestare iuramentum fidelitatis {om. &Pe}
papae sicut vasallus domino suo, quod {*om.
&NaRe} electus se intromittere non debet de
regno nisi electio papae praesentetur {*trs.

Student It seems to me generally that if the
empire is from the pope and the emperor
ought to fulfil his oath of fidelity like a
vassal to his lord, the one who has been
elected should not involve himself in the
kingdom unless his election is presented to
the pope and the pope has declared his wish
about whether he wants the elected to
involve himself in the kingdom. Now,
therefore, follow up with another opinion
and try to argue for it.

Magister Quod electus statim debet {*debeat
&NaRe} administrare videtur multipliciter
{modo &Pe} posse probari. Nam consuetudo in
talibus rationabilis maxime est spectanda et
conservanda {*servanda &MzNaPeRe} sed
consuetudo rationabilis {*rationalis &NaRe}
fuit ab initio quod electus statim se intromittat
{*intromisit &NaRe} {intromittit &Mz} {*trs.
&MzNaPeRe} antequam praesentetur
{*praesentaretur &MzNaRe} electio {*trs.
&MzNaRe} papae. Imperatores enim tam
{*om. &MzNaPeRe} fideles {*infideles
&MzNaPeRe}, qui fuerunt imperatores veri
quam {*quamvis &NaRe} infideles, {infidelis
&Mz} {qui fuerunt ... infideles om. &Pe}
nullam electionem praesentaverunt papae nec
ipsum in aliquo requirebant. Quidam etiam
imperatores {*trs. &NaRe} qui coronati fuerunt
a papa in imperatores licet praesentaverunt
{*praesentaverint &MzNaPeRe} et {*vel
&NaRe} notificaverunt {*notificaverint
&MzNaPeRe} papae electionem {*trs.

Master It seems provable in many ways
that the one who has been elected should at
once administer. For in matters of this kind
a reasonable custom especially should be
observed and preserved, but it was a
reasonable custom from the beginning that
the one who was elected involved himself
at once before his election was presented to
the pope. For unbelieving emperors, who
were true emperors although they were
unbelievers, did not present any election to
the pope and did not need him in anything.
Some emperors too who were crowned as
emperors by the pope did indeed administer
and were crowned with another crown or
crowns before their coronation in Rome
with the golden crown, although they did
notify or present their election to the pope.
Therefore, that custom that the one who has
been elected should at once begin to
administer should be preserved.
