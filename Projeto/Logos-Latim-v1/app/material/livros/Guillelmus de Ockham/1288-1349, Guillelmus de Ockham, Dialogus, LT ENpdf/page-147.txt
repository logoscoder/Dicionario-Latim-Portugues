multo magis qui compellit alios haeresim pertinaciter
defensare vel haeresi pertinaciter adhaerere est
pertinax et haereticus iudicandus.

is not opposed is approved, and truth is struck down
when it is not defended." [col.293] It is clearly
gathered from these and very many others that he who
agrees with heretical wickedness is counted among
heretics. He who forces others pertinaciously to defend
a heresy or pertinaciously to cling to a heresy,
therefore, should be judged even more to be
pertinacious and a heretic.

Secunda ratio est haec. Non minus peccant qui alios
cogunt minis, terroribus, iuramentis vel praeceptis aut
comminationibus ad peccatum quam qui mandant aliis
aliquod committere crimen. Sed qui mandant aliis
aliquod crimen committere consimili crimine
involvuntur. Ergo qui cogunt alios ad peccatum
quodcunque consimili peccato tenentur et per
consequens qui cogunt alios pravitatem haereticam
pertinaciter defensare sunt consimili pertinacia irretiti.
Maior istius rationis est nota de se. Minor probatur
auctoritate Innocentii 3, qui, ut habetur Extra, De
sententia excommunicationis, c. Mulieres, ait, "Cum is
vere committat cuius auctoritate vel mandato delictum
committi probatur". Ergo qui mandant aliis ut crimen
committant consimili crimine involvuntur.

A second argument is this. Those who force others
into sin by threats, terror, oaths, commands or
menaces do not sin any less than those who order
others to commit some crime. But those who order
others to commit some crime are caught up in the
same crime. Those who force others into any sort of
sin, therefore, are bound by the same sin and
consequently those who force others pertinaciously to
defend heretical wickedness are entangled in the same
pertinacity. The major [premise] of this argument is
self-evident. The minor [premise] is proved by the
authority of Innocent III, who says, as we find in
Extra, De sententia excommunicationis, c. Mulieres
[col.891], "... since he truly commits a crime on whose
authority or order it is proved that it was committed."
Those who order others to commit a crime, therefore,
are caught up in the same crime.

Tertio ratio est haec. Ille dicitur facere qui per alium
facit. Unde et ille dicitur occidere vere qui per alium
occidit, teste Clemente 3, qui, ut habetur Extra, De
clericis pugnantibus in duello, c. Henricus, ait,
"Homicidium tam facto quam praecepto sive consilio
aut defensione non est dubium perpetrari." Ergo
consimiliter ille dicitur haeresim pertinaciter defensare
qui per alium haeresim pertinaciter defendit. Sed qui
cogit alios haeresim pertinaciter defensare, pertinaciter
haeresim defensat per alios. Ergo ipse debet dici
haeresis pertinax defensator.

The third argument is this. He is said to do something
who does it through another. Thus he is also said truly
to kill who kills through another, as Clement III
attests, who says, as we find in Extra, De clericis
pugnantibus in duello. c. Henricus, [col.805] "There is
no doubt that a homicide is perpetrated both by deed
and by command, or by advice or in defence." In a
similar way, therefore, he is said pertinaciously to
defend a heresy who defends a heresy pertinaciously
through another. But he who forces others
pertinaciously to defend a heresy, pertinaciously
defends that heresy through others. He ought to be
called, therefore, a pertinacious defender of heresy.

Quarta ratio est haec. Magis dicitur facere cogens
quam consulens. Sed ille cuius consilio aliquod crimen
committitur dicitur idem crimen committere, teste
Augustino, qui, ut habetur De Poenitentia, dist. 1. c.
Perniciose, ait, "Se decipiunt qui existimant eos
tantum homicidas esse qui manibus hominem occidunt
et non potius eos per quorum consilium, fraudem et
exhortationem homines extinguuntur. Nam Iudaei
Dominum nequaquam propriis manibus occiderunt,
sicut scriptum est, 'Nobis non licet interficere
quenquam'. Sed tamen illis Domini mors imputatur
quia ipsi eum lingua interfecerunt, dicentes, 'Crucifige,
crucifige eum'." Ergo multo magis qui cogit alium ut
crimen committat idem crimen committit, et ita qui
cogit alium haeresim pertinaciter defensare ipse
noscitur haeresim pertinaciter defensare.

A fourth argument is this. Someone who forces is said
to do [something], more than someone who advises.
But he by whose advice some crime is committed is
said to commit that same crime, as Augustine attests,
saying, as we find in De Poenitentia, dist. 1. c.
Perniciose, "They deceive themselves wickedly who
think that the only murderers are those who kill a
person with their hands, and not, even more, those
through whose advice, deceit and encouragement
people are killed. For the Jews did not kill the Lord
with their own hands, as it is written that `we are not
permitted to kill anyone', yet the Lord's death is
attributed to them because they killed him with their
tongue by saying `Crucify! Crucify him!'" [col.1163]
It is much more the case, therefore, that he who forces
another to commit a crime, commits that same crime;
