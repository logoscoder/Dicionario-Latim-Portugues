eum quaerenti Domino, quem discipuli dicerent ipsum
esse, respondisse notabit, 'Tu es Christus, filius Dei
vivi.'" Ex quibus verbis patenter habetur quod ad
sedem beati Petri est quaestio fidei referenda et ita nec
collegium inferius concilio generali nec aliquis
episcopus inferior papa potest aliquam haeresim de qua
est dubium an sit haeresis condemnare et per
consequens nullum talem haeresim asserentem valet
tanquam haereticum condemnare. Irrationabile enim
videtur omnino quod episcopus vel inquisitor
haereticae pravitatis, qui saepe sacrae paginae
imperitus existit, opiniones doctorum theologiae posset
tanquam haereticas condemnare.

are the Christ, the son of the living God", will
understand that the church's greater causes, especially
those touching on the articles of faith, should be
referred to Peter's see." It is clearly established from
these words that a question of faith should be referred
to the see of blessed Peter, and so no gathering less
than a general council and no bishop less than the
pope can condemn any heresy about which there is
doubt whether it is a heresy, and can not,
consequently, condemn as a heretic anyone affirming
such a heresy. For it would seem completely irrational
that a bishop or inquisitor into heretical wickedness,
who is often ignorant of the sacred page, could
condemn as heretical the opinions of doctors of
theology.

Some problematic cases
Discipulus Quamvis ista sententia videatur fortiter esse
probata, tamen contra ipsam urgentes instantias in
mente revolvo. Quarum prima est de Universitate
Parisiensi quae multas opiniones, etiam Thomae de
Aquino,
ipso
vivente,
tanquam
erroneas
excommunicavit et damnavit. Secunda est de duobus
archiepiscopis Cantuariensibus, quorum primus erat
doctor theologiae in Ordine Praedicatorum et postea
cardinalis, secundus erat etiam doctor theologiae de
Ordine Fratrum Minorum, qui plures opiniones Thome
excommunicaverunt et damnaverunt. Tertia est de
Ordine Fratrum Minorum qui doctrinam Fratris Petri
Iohannis damnavit, et ita videtur quod tam ad
collegium inferius concilio generali quam ad alias
personas inferiores summo pontifice spectat errores a
theologis opinatos damnare. Quamobrem qualiter
respondetur ad praedictas instantias manifesta.

Student Although that opinion seems to have been
proved strongly, yet I am in my mind reflecting on
some objections which urge against it. The first of
these concerns the University of Paris which
excommunicated and condemned as erroneous many
opinions, even of Thomas Aquinas while he was still
alive. [See E. Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy
in the Middle Ages (London, 1955), p. 417] The
second concerns two archbishops of Canterbury, the
first of whom was a doctor of theology from the Order
of Preachers and later a cardinal [Robert Kilwardby];
the second was also a doctor of theology from the
Order of Friars Minor [John Pecham]; they
excommunicated and condemned many of Thomas's
opinions. [See Gilson, pp. 406, 359]. The third
concerns the Order of Friars Minor which condemned
the teaching of brother Peter John. [See David Burr,
Olivi and Franciscan Poverty (Philadelphia:
Pennsylvania University Press, 1989), chapter 4, p.
88ff and pp. 109 and 125. See also Leo Amor√≥s,
"Series condemnationum et processuum contra
doctrinam et sequaces Petri Ioannis Olivi", Archivum
franciscanum historicum, 24 (1931), pp. 399-451 -- a
document that may have been composed by
Bonagratia of Bergamo, written post 1328. On p. 509
it mentions a Chapter at Marseilles, called by Michael
of Cesena in 1319, which examined the errors of Peter
John Olivi and condemned them and passed sentence
of excommunication against every brother who
knowingly held and used his books.] And so it seems
that it pertains both to a gathering inferior to a general
council and to other persons inferior to the highest
pontiff to condemn the errors put forward as opinions
by theologians. Make clear, therefore, how reply is
made to the above objections.
