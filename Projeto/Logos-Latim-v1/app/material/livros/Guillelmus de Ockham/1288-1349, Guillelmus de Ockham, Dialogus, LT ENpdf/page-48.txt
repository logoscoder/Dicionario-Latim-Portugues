condemnari.

heretic if he is found to be pertinacious.

Discipulus Ista responsio mihi videtur apparens nisi
quod dubito de qua ecclesia isti loquuntur.

Student That reply seems clear to me, except that I
am uncertain of which church they are speaking
about.

Magister Ipsi loquuntur de ecclesia quae est concilium
generale vel papa quia non sufficit in hoc casu ad
damnationem alicuius quod innotescat alicui alteri
quam concilio generali vel papae quod talis assertio
fuerit et sit haeretica.

Master They are speaking about the church which is a
general council or a pope, because in this case it does
not suffice for someone's condemnation that it
becomes known to anyone other than a general
council or a pope that such an assertion was and is
heretical.

Discipulus Dic quomodo respondent ad exempla de
Graecis et Ioachim et illis qui dixerunt Christum non
esse aliquid secundum quod homo.

Student Tell me how they reply to the examples of
the Greeks and Joachim and those who have said that
Christ is nothing as a man.

Magister Dicunt quod assertiones illae antea fuerunt
haereticae, pertinaces etiam assertores earum fuerunt
haeretici, quia tamen antea non innotuerat ecclesiae
quod eorum assertiones erant haereticae non debuerunt
tanquam haeretici condemnari, sed postea debuerunt
tamquam haeretici condemnari.

Master They say that those assertions were heretical
before, and those who affirmed them pertinaciously
were also heretics, yet because it had not earlier
become known to the church that their assertions were
heretical they should not have been condemned as
heretics, but afterwards they should have been
condemned as heretics.

Discipulus Intelligo responsionem eorum ad rationem
illam. Dicas ergo quomodo respondent ad secundam.

Student I understand their reply to that argument.
Would you tell me therefore how they reply to the
second.

Magister Respondent quod licet ad summum
pontificem non solum per modum doctrinae sed etiam
autentice pertineat diffinire quae assertio catholica,
quae haeretica est censenda, non tamen potest facere de
veritate non catholica veritatem catholicam nec de
assertione non haeretica haereticam valet efficere. Quo
tamen non obstante, diffinitio sua plus operatur quam
determinatio doctoris, quia post determinationem
doctoris licet cuilibet, sicut prius, contrarium opinari et
publice opinando tenere; hoc autem non licet post
determinationem summi pontificis. Aliud etiam
operatur quia post diffinitionem rectam summi
pontificis licet cuilibet episcopo et inquisitori
haereticae pravitatis contra tenentes contrarium illius
quod rite per summum pontificem diffinitum extitit
procedere iuxta canonicas sanctiones, nisi tales
offerrent se ad probandum summum pontificem
erronee diffinisse, in quo casu esset ad generale
concilium recurrendum. Post determinationem autem
cuiuscumque doctoris non licet episcopis et
inquisitoribus pravitatis haereticae contra tenentes
contrarium procedere magis quam ante.

Master They reply that although it pertains to the
highest pontiff to define not only by means of
teaching but also by authority which assertion should
be considered catholic and which heretical, yet he can
not make catholic a truth which is not catholic nor is
he able to make heretical an assertion which is not
heretical. Nevertheless, notwithstanding this, his
definition has more effect than the determination of a
doctor because after the determination of a doctor
anyone at all is permitted, just as before, to opine, and
to maintain publicly by opining, the opposite; this is
not permitted, however, after a determination by the
highest pontiff. It also has another effect because after
a correct definition by the highest pontiff any bishop
or inquisitor into heretical wickedness is permitted to
proceed in accord with canonical laws against those
holding the opposite of what has been rightly defined
by the highest pontiff, unless such people bring
themselves forward to prove that the highest pontiff
has made an erroneous definition, in which case
recourse should be had to a general council. After a
determination by any doctor at all, however, bishops
and inquisitors into heretical wickedness are not
permitted to proceed against those holding the
contrary more than they were before.
