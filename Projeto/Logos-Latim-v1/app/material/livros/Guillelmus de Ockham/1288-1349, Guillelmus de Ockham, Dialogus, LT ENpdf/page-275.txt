this that Peter possessed coercive jurisdiction.

Christum, quia de potestate coactiva intelliguntur verba [Marsilius, II.iv.12] From these words we gather that
Christi cum ad verba Pilati dicentis "mihi non loqueris, Pilate had coercive jurisdiction over Christ, because
nescis quia potestatem habeo crucifigere te et Christ's statement must be understood as referring to
potestatem habeo dimittere te" respondit. Constat autem coercive power, since he is replying to the utterance of

thee, and I have power to release thee?" But it is plain
that Pilate spoke of coercive power, therefore so did
Christ.

this point.
