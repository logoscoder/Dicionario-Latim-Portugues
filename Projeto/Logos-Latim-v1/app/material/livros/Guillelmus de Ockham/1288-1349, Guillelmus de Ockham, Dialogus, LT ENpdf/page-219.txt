Magister Aliter dicitur quod Romana ecclesia a Christo
immediate, quando ordinavit beatum Petrum in summum
pontificem, dicens, "Tu es Petrus", et cetera, super
omnes ecclesias primatum ac principatum accepit.

Master: Otherwise it is said that the Roman church
received primacy and dominion over all churches
directly from Christ when he appointed blessed
Peter as highest pontiff by saying [Matt. 16:18],
"You are Peter" etc.

Hoc Pelagius papa, ut habetur in decretis dist. 21, c.
Quamvis aperte, sentire videtur aperte cum dicit, "Sancta
Romana ecclesia catholica et apostolica nullis synodicis
constitutis ceteris ecclesiis prelata est, sed evangelica
voce Domini et salvatoris nostri primatum obtinuit: 'Tu
es', inquit Dominus, 'Petrus et super hanc petram
edificabo ecclesiam meam.'"

As we find in the decretals at dist. 21, c. Quamvis
[col.70], Pope Pelagius [really Gelasius] seems
clearly to believe this when he says, "The holy,
catholic and apostolic Roman church was not
preferred to the rest of the churches by any decrees
of a synod but obtained primacy by the words of our
Lord and Saviour in the gospel when the Lord said,
'You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my
church.'"

Hoc eciam Nicolaus papa videtur asserere qui, ut legitur
22, dist. c. 1 ait, "Omnes sive patriarche in cuiuslibet
apicem, sive metropoleon primatus, aut episcopatuum
cathedras, vel ecclesiarum cuiuslibet ordinis dignitatem
instituit Romana ecclesia. Illam vero solus ipse fundavit
et supra petram fidei mox nascentis erexit." Et parum
post, "Non ergo quelibet terrena sentencia sed illud
verbum quo constitutum est celum et terra, per quod
denique omnia condita sunt elementa Romanam fundavit
ecclesiam."

Pope Nicholas seems to affirm this too when he
says, as we read in dist. 22, c. 1 [col.73], "The
Roman church established everyone, whether it was
the honour of any patriarch, the primacy of
metropolitans, the sees of bishoprics and the dignity
of churches of any order. But that church he alone
founded and built on that rock of a faith just coming
into being ... It was not therefore any earthly opinion
that founded the Roman church but that word by
which heaven and earth were set up and through
which all the elements were founded."

Hiis eciam beatus Anacletus consentire videtur qui, ut
habetur dist. eadem c. Sacrosancta, ait, "Sacrosancta
Romana ecclesia et apostolica non ab apostolis sed ab
ipso Domino salvatore nostro primatum obtinuit, sicut
beato Petro dixit, 'Tu es Petrus et super hanc Petram
edificabo ecclesiam meam.'"

Blessed Anacletus also seems to agree with these
two when he says, as we find at the same distinction,
c. Sacrosancta [col.73], "The sacrosanct apostolic
Roman church obtained primacy not from the
apostles but from the Lord our Saviour himself ... as
he said to Peter, 'You are Peter, and on this rock I
will build my church.'"

Hoc eciam Gelasius papa, ut legitur 9, q. 3, c. Cuncta,
approbare videtur. Ait enim, "Apostolica sedes sine ulla
synodo precedente et solvendi quod inique synodus
dampnaverat et, dampnandi, nulla existente synodo, quos
oportuit habuit facultatem, et hoc nimirum pro suo
principatu quem beatus Petrus apostolus Domini voce et
tenuit semper et tenebit."

Pope Gelasius seems to agree with this too, as we
read in 9, q. 3, c. Cuncta. For he says [col.611],
"Without any synod preceding it the apostolic see
had the power both to absolve anything that a synod
had wrongly condemned and to condemn those
whom it so befitted without there being a synod, and
it doubtless had this on account of the dominion
which the apostle blessed Peter at the word of the
Lord has always held and will continue to hold at
the word of the Lord.

Item Leo papa, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Cum beatissimus,
ait, "Cum beatissimus Petrus apostolus a Domino
acceperit principatum, et Romana ecclesia in eius
remaneat institutis [...]."

Again, as we find at 24, q. 1, c. Cum beatissimus,
Pope Leo says [col.971], "Since the blessed apostle
Peter received dominion from the Lord, and the
Roman church remains as established by him ... ."

Ex hiis omnibus datur intelligi quod Romana ecclesia ab
ipso Christo ante ascensionem eius in celum recepit et
habuit super omnes alias ecclesias principatum.

We are given to understand by all these that the
Roman church received and obtained dominion over
all other churches from Christ himself before his
ascension into heaven.
