happened can be clarified as follows, that these things have been known in part to those who are of greater
dignity, through whose ministry these things were announced as by household messengers; to those, however,
who are of lesser dignity, they were unknown&#8221;. From these words it is plainly certain that although some
angels knew the secrets before the incarnation, nevertheless some angels of lower rank who see God did not
know them at all; and thus not all who see God see all things.
Again, our saviour seems to testify that not all who see [God] know all things, but they are ignorant of some
things. In Matthew 24[:36] he says: &#8220;Concerning that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels nor
the son". And thus the angels of heaven can therefore see God although they do not know all things.
Further, the apostle Paul in a rapture saw the divine essence, as was shown above, and yet Paul did not know all
things, and thus not everyone who sees God knows all things.
Again, in Colossians 2[:3] the Apostle says of Christ individually, &#8220;in whom are all treasures of wisdom
and hidden knowledge&#8221;. That should therefore not be attributed to the others who see God, for this is a
singular privilege of Christ&#8217;s soul, that he alone among spirits seeing God has foreknowledge. This
seems provable from the words of the Gospel according to John, 3[:34]: for only to Christ has the spirit been
given &#8220;not by measure&#8221;, therefore only Christ had all knowledge, and thus one seeing God can be
ignorant.
With these matters seen, it is easy to refute the above argument running through it. For when, first, he says that
the blessed vision is not consistent with learning, it must be said that this is erroneous, as was said before.
And when, second, he says, proving the minor through this, &#8220;For whoever clearly sees God sees all
things, according to blessed Gregory, who says, &#8216;What does he not see who sees the one who sees all
things?&#8217;&#8221;, it must be said, according to what the Master of the Sentences says, book 2, dist. 11
[para. 8, col. 675], in these words, &#8220;Gregory also says this in his book Dialogues, &#8216;What do they
fail to know there where they know the one who knows all things?&#8217; He seems to say that the angels
know all things, and that there is nothing they do not know, but this is to be interpreted of things of which
knowledge makes the knower blessed, as are the things that pertain to the mystery of trinity and unity&#8221;.
These are the words of the Master of the Sentences, who holds that the angels seeing God do not know all things,
and that Gregory did not speak of knowledge of creatures, but of the things that pertain to the mystery of the
divine trinity and unity.
And when, third [not found in text above], he draws the inference, &#8220;And consequently, according to
blessed Gregory, whoever sees God face-to-face is not ignorant of any things that happen here among the living,
nor are they taught by anyone else, nor is anything revealed to them that they did not see before&#8221;, it must
be said that he infers three erroneous conclusions from the words of Gregory misunderstood (as has been shown
from the Master of the Sentences). The first is that those who see God face-to-face are not ignorant of anything.
The second is that they are not taught by anyone. The third is that nothing they did not see before is revealed to
them. These have been proved above to be erroneous by means of the apostle Paul and the Gloss.
The text of Augustine he quotes must be granted, according to a good interpretation. For whether
Augustine&#8217;s statement is understood of the dead who see God or of others, it must be granted that all the
dead do not know all things that happen here, because, as has been shown, even those who see God do not see all
things.
And therefore, finally, when he concludes, &#8220;Since, therefore, they do not see all things, consequently also
they do not clearly see God face-to-face&#8221;, it must be said that it does not follow, just as it does not
follow, &#8220;The good angels did not see all things before the incarnation, therefore they did not clearly see
God&#8221;.
CHAPTER 4
It continues in the worthless protestation mentioned, because he says logically that to seeing and investigating
the truth of this conclusion three things should be attended to, first to whom the reward of clear vision of God is
promised, second the time for which the reward is promised, and third to what the general judgment to come is
ordained. Once these points are laid down, upon which he bases the three last ways upon which he rests, he
immediately adds something concerning him to whom it is promised, in which the first way of his proof consists,
as follows.
If we consider to whom that reward is promised in sacred scripture, it is certain that it is to the whole person.
This is proved first: for James, 1[:12], says, &#8220;Blessed the man who endures temptation&#8221; etc, and it
is certain that the soul is not the man. Second to the same [conclusion]: for Christ says, &#8220;Everyone who
leaves father&#8221; etc., &#8220;will have eternal life&#8221; etc. [Matthew 19:28]. And it is certain that
those to whom he spoke were persons, and not separate souls. To the same conclusion is what Christ says,
&#8220;You who leave all&#8221; etc. [not found], and it is certain that those who were there were blessed
Peter and other persons, and not their separated souls. Again, that reward will be rendered for works of mercy,
whence Christ will say in the judgment, &#8220;I thirsted&#8221; etc; but it is certain that persons, and not
separated souls, gave alms; therefore the reward will be rendered to the person, and not to the separated soul.
