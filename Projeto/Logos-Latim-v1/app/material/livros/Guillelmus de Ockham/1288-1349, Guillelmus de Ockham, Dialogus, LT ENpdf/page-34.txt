Cyprianus eminebat, non esse posse apud haereticos
vel schismaticos baptismum Christi, nisi ubi quia non
distinguebatur sacramentum ab effectu vel usu
sacramenti, et quia eius effectu atque eius usus in
liberatione a peccatis et cordis rectitudine apud
haereticos
non
inveniebatur,
ipsum
quoque
sacramentum illic non esse putabant." Haec est
sententia beati Cypriani de sacramentis haereticorum,
cuius contrarium Augustinus ibidem asserit.

whom blessed Cyprian is especially prominent, that
Christian baptism can not exist among heretics and
schismatics except because a sacrament was not
distinguished from its effect or use, and because its
effect and use were not found free from sin and with
uprightness of heart among heretics they thought that
the sacrament itself was also not there." This is the
opinion of blessed Cyprian about sacraments
[administered by] heretics, the opposite of which
Augustine asserts in that place.

Manifeste ergo sancti circa sacramenta ecclesiae
contraria dogmatizant. Hinc dist. 32 para. Ad hoc vero
legitur, "Sciendum vero est quod canones apostolorum,
quorum auctoritate orientalis et ex parte utitur Romana
ecclesia, et insignis martyr Cyprianus et 80 episcopi
cum eodem baptisma haereticorum lavacrum diaboli
appellant. Stephanus vero et Cornelius martyres et
pontifices Romani et venerabilis Augustinus in libro
De baptismate, eundem Cyprianum et praefatos
episcopos ob hanc causam vehementer redarguunt,
affirmantes baptisma sive ab haeretico sive a
schismatico ecclesiastico more celebratum esse ratum."
Ex his colligitur quod Cyprianus et Augustinus de
sacramentis ecclesiae contraria tradiderunt, quae etiam
reperiuntur in scriptis eorum, sicut ex praedictis et
capitulo eiusdem Cypriani quod habetur 1, q. 1, c. Si
quis patet aperte. Non igitur omnibus assertionibus in
operibus sanctorum inventis debet catholicus
adhaerere.

Clearly therefore saints propound opposing dogmas
about the sacraments of the church. Hence we read in
dist. 32, para. Ad hoc vero [col.118], "It should indeed
be known that the canons of the apostles, to whose
authority the eastern church and in part the Roman
church yield, and the worthy martyr Cyprian and 80
bishops with him call baptism by heretics the bath of
the devil. But Stephen and Cornelius, martyrs and
bishops of Rome, and the venerable Augustine in his
book On baptism vehemently contradicted Cyprian
and those bishops on that account, asserting that a
baptism celebrated according to ecclesiastical custom,
whether by a heretic or a schismatic, is valid." We
gather from these [words] that Cyprian and Augustine
handed down opposing opinions about the sacraments
of the church, and these [opinins] are indeed found in
their writings, as is quite clear from the above and
from the chapter from Cyprian which is found in 1, q.
1, c. Si quis [col.382]. It is not the case, therefore, that
a catholic must adhere to all the assertions found in
the works of the saints.

Discipulus De sanctorum libris tam aperte probasti
quod non sunt in omnibus approbandi quod nequeo
dissentire. Ex quo sequi videtur quod nihil auctoritatis
remansit in eis quia, sicut instrumenta ita etiam
scripturae, quaecunque quae in parte inveniuntur falsae
in totum reprobantur vel saltem suspectae redduntur.
Unde et de Scripturis Sacris, ut habetur dist. 9, c. Si ad
scripturas, asserit Augustinus quod si ad eas admissa
fuerint vel officiosa mendacia nihil auctoritatis
remanebit in eis. Dic ergo quomodo isti respondent ad
id quod de approbatione opusculorum sanctorum, inter
quae etiam opuscula Cypriani et Augustini et
Hieronymi numerantur, dist. 15 legitur manifeste.

Student You have proved so clearly of books by
saints that they do not have to be approved in their
entirety that I can not disagree. It seems to follow
from this that no authority remains in them because,
just as with instruments so also with writings,
whichever of them is found to be partly false is wholly
rejected, or at least rendered suspect. Hence
Augustine even asserts about the sacred scriptures, as
we find in dist. 9, c. Si ad scripturas [col.17], that if
even dutiful falsehoods be admitted to be in them
nothing authoritative will remain in them. Tell me,
therefore, how they reply to what we clearly read in
dist. 15 about the approval of the works of saints,
among which are certainly numbered the works of
Cyprian, Augustine and Jerome.

Magister Dicunt isti quod non omnia opuscula
sanctorum quantum ad omnia contenta in eis sunt per
ecclesiam approbata. Constat enim quod in libris beati
Augustini multa inveniuntur contraria veritati, quae
etiam ipse postmodum retractavit, et ita illa minime
approbantur. Et sicut est de libris beati Augustini ita est
de libris multorum aliorum sanctorum quod
nequaquam quo ad omnia approbantur. Omnes tamen

Master They say that not all the works of saints, in
respect of everything contained in them, have been
approved by the church. For it is certain that many
things opposed to the truth are found in the books of
blessed Augustine and that he himself in fact later
retracted these, and so they should not be approved.
And just as it is with blessed Augustine's books, so it
is also with the books of many other saints, that they
