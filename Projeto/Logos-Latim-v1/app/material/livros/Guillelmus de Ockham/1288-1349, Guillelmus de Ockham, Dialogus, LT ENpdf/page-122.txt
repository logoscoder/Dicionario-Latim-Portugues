Secundo sic. Negans assertionem catholicam potest per
solam simplicitatem aut ignorantiam de pravitate
haeretica excusari; sed negans assertionem catholicam
apud omnes catholicos divulgatam non potest per
simplicitatem vel ignorantiam excusari

Second as follows. Someone denying a catholic
assertion can be excused of heretical wickedness only
through simplicity or ignorance; but someone denying
a catholic assertion published among all catholics can
not be excused by (a) simplicity or (b) ignorance.

Quod non per simplicitatem patet quia positum est
quod talis negans est capax rationis et intelligens. Si
enim careret usu rationis vel esset alienatus a sensu
bene excusaretur. Sed intelligens et industrius per
simplicitatem excusari non potest.

That he can not [be excused] by (a) simplicity is clear
because it was assumed that the one denying is
capable of reason and has understanding. (For if he
lacked the use of reason or were insane he would
indeed be excused.) But an aware person who has
understanding can not be excused by simplicity.

Nec potest per ignorantiam excusari, quia ignorantia
iuris divini apud omnes promulgati non excusat, sicut
nec ignorantia iuris naturalis excusat, secundum quod
legitur in decretis 1, q. 4, para. Notandum. Si ergo
assertio negata sit apud omnes catholicos promulgata
negans eam nequit de pertinacia et pravitate haeretica
excusari.

Nor can he be excused by (b) ignorance, because
ignorance of a divine law that has been made known
among everyone does not excuse, just as ignorance of
natural law does not excuse, as we read in 1. q. 4.
para. Notandum [col.422]. If the assertion denied has
been made known among all catholics, therefore, the
one denying it can not be excused of pertinacity and
heretical wickedness.

Discipulus Quid si in rei veritate ignoraret talem
assertionem ad fidem catholicam pertinere? Nunquid
apud Deum excusaretur si absque pertinacia eam
negaret?

Disciple What if, in truth of fact, he were ignorant
that such an assertion pertains to catholic faith?
Would he be excused by God if he were to deny it
without pertinacity?

Magister Respondetur quod apud Deum excusaretur et
etiam apud ecclesiam si probare valeret se ignorasse
assertionem negatam apud catholicos esse tanquam
catholicam divulgatam. Sicut si quis inter aliquos
Christianos in aliqua una domo semper fuisset a
pueritia nutritus, licet postea ex ignorantia diceret
Christum non fuisse crucifixum et non pertinaciter
adhaereret, eum non deberet ecclesia pertinacem et
haereticum reputare si omnes cum quibus fuerat
conversatus testimonium perhiberent quod nunquam
aliquis eorum de crucifixione Christi fuisset sibi
locutus.

Master The reply is that he would be excused by
God, and by the church too if he could prove that he
had not known that the assertion he denied was
published among catholics as catholic. For example,
if someone had been brought up from childhood
always in some one house among certain christians
and afterwards were to say out of ignorance that
Christ had not been crucified and were not to cling to
this pertinaciously, the church ought not to regard him
as pertinacious and a heretic if all those with whom he
had lived were to present testimony that none of them
had ever spoken to him about the crucifixion of
Christ.

Discipulus Circa tales casus, qui forte nunquam
evenerunt, minime te dilates, sed loquamur de illis
Christianis qui cum Christianis communiter
conversantur, ecclesias intrant, et de his quae ad fidem
pertinent Christianam saepe audiunt conferentes. Et de
talibus adhuc proba, si vales, quod negantes
assertionem catholicam apud omnes catholicos
divulgatam statim sunt pertinaces et haeretici iudicandi.

Disciple Do not enlarge on cases like this, which
perhaps have never occurred, but let us talk about
those christians who live in a community with
christians, go into churches and often hear people
discussing matters which pertain to the christian faith.
Offer further proof, if you can, that if such people
deny an assertion published among all catholics as
catholic they should be judged immediately to be
pertinacious and heretics.

Magister Hoc tertio sic probatur. Qui negat
assertionem catholicam quam debet et tenetur explicite
credere est pertinax et haereticus reputandus. Sed
quilibet Christianus tenetur explicite credere omnem
assertionem catholicam apud omnes catholicos

Master It is proved in a third way, as follows. He
who denies a catholic assertion which he ought and is
bound explicitly to believe should be regarded as
pertinacious and a heretic; every christian is bound
explicitly to believe every catholic assertion published
