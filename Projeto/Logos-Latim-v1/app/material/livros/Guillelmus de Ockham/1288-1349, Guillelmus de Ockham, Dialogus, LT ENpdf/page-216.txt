(3) It was the other apostles who appointed Peter to rule them
Tercia assercio eorum est quod beatus Petrus ex
ordinacione apostolorum super ipsos habuit principatum.
Quod auctoritate beati Anacleti que ponitur dist. 21, c. In
novo ostendunt. Ait enim, loquens de beato Petro,
"Ceteri vero apostoli cum eodem pari consorcio honorem
et potestatem acceperunt ipsumque principem eorum
esse voluerunt." Ergo eleccione apostolorum beatus
Petrus fuit factus princeps eorum.

Their third assertion is that it was by their decree
that blessed Peter had dominion over the apostles.
They show this by a text from blessed Anacletus
which is located in dist. 21, c. In novo. For speaking
about blessed Peter he says [col.69], "Indeed the rest
of the apostles were equal in fellowship in the
honour and power they received, and wanted him to
be their chief." It was, therefore, by the choice of the
apostles that Peter was made their chief.

(4) So far as their power is from Christ, priests are equal
Quarta assercio eorum est quod ex ordinacione Christi
nullus sacerdos super alios habet aliquam potestatem.
Nec unus habet maiorem potestatem super gregem sibi
commissum quam alius ex constitucione Christi. Sed
omnis superioritas unius sacerdotis super alium in
remedium scismatis et propter bonum commune ab ipsis
est sacerdotibus instituta. Hoc autem auctoritate Ieronimi
que ponitur dist. 93, c. Legimus probare nituntur. Ait
enim, "Cum Apostolus perspicue doceat eosdem esse
episcopos quos presbyteros, quid patitur mensarum et
viduarum minister?" etc. Et infra, "Audivi aliud
testimonium in quo manifestissime declaratur vel
comprobatur eundem esse episcopum atque presbyterum
'Propter hoc reliqui te Crete, ut que deerant corrigeres et
constitueres presbyteros per civitates sicut ego tibi
mandavi. Si quis est sine crimine, unius uxoris vir, filios
habens fideles, non in accusacione luxurie aut non
subditos. Oportet enim episcopum esse sine crimine
quasi Dei dispensatorem.' Et ad Timotheum, 'Noli
negligere graciam que tibi data est per propheciam et per
imposicionem manus presbyteri.' Sed et Petrus in prima
epistola, 'Presbyteros qui in vobis sunt precor
compresbyter.'" Et infra, "Parva tibi videntur tantorum
virorum testimonia? Clangat tuba evangelica filius
tonitrui quem Jhesus amavit plurimum, qui de pectore
Salvatoris doctrinarum fluenta potavit, 'Presbyter electe
Domine et filiis eius quos ego diligo in veritate.' Et in
alia epistola, 'Presbyter Gaio carissimo quem ego in
veritate diligo.' Quod autem postea unus electus est qui
ceteris preponeretur in scismatis remedium factum est ne
unusquisque ad se trahens ecclesiam Christi rumperet.
Nam et Alexandrie a Marco Evangelista usque ad Bedam
et Dionysium episcopos presbyteri semper ex se unum
eligebant et in excelsiori gradu collocabant, quem
episcopum nominabant, quomodo si exercitus sibi
imperatorem faciat." Ex quibus verbis colligunt isti quod
inter presbyteros de quibus exemplificat beatus
Hieronimus, nulla erat superioritas ex ordinacione
Christi, cum post exempla supradicta omnia dicat
Hieronimus, "Quod autem postea unus electus est qui
ceteris preponeretur in scismatis remedium factum est."
Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi quod prelacio unius
presbyteri super alios post ordinacionem Christi ab ipsis
216

Their fourth assertion is that by Christ's decree no
priest has any power over other [priests]. Nor does
anyone by Christ's arrangement have any greater
power than any other over the flock committed to
him. But any superiority of one priest over another
was established by priests themselves as a remedy
for schism and for the common good. They try to
prove this by a text from Jerome located in dist. 93,
c. Legimus. For he says [col.327], "Although the
Apostle manifestly teaches that bishops and priests
are the same, what does a minister experience of
tables and widows? ... I have heard other testimony
which makes it very clear or manifestly establishes
that a bishop is the same as a priest [Titus 1:5-7],
"For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and
shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also
appointed thee. If any be without crime, the husband
of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of
riot, or unruly. For a bishop must be without crime,
as the steward of God.' And [1] Tim. [4:14 says],
'Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was
given thee by prophecy with imposition of the hands
of the priesthood.' But in his first letter [5:1] Peter
says, 'As a priest myself I beseech the priests among
you ... .' ... Do the testimonies of such great men
seem insignificant to you? The son of thunder whom
Jesus loved dearly, who drank in the teachings
flowing from the Saviour's heart, sounds forth with
his apostolic trumpet [2 John 1]: 'The priest to the
elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth.'
And in another letter [3 John 1 he says], 'The priest
to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.'
That one was chosen later, however, who was set
over the rest was done as a remedy for schism lest
everyone should burst Christ's church asunder by
taking it to himself. For indeed from Mark the
evangelist at Alexandria to the bishops Bede and
Dionysius priests always chose one from among
themselves and placed him, whom they called a
bishop, in a higher position, just as the army makes
an emperor for itself." They gather from those words
that there was by Christ's decree no superiority
