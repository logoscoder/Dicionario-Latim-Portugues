impiis assumantur, ut asserit Nicolaus papa, prout
habetur dist. 8, c. Mala; ergo multo fortius haereses
qualitercunque pullulaverint sunt evellendae radicitus
et damnandae ne a simplicibus et seducibilibus pro
veritatibus catholicis approbentur.

burdensome and evil customs should be very quickly
repressed lest they be adopted by the impious as a
right and privilege, as Pope Nicholas affirms, as we
find in dist. 8, c. Mala [col.14]; it is much more the
case, therefore, that howsoever heresies come forth
they should be completely rooted out and condemned
lest they be approved as catholic truths by those who
are simple and may be misled.

Discipulus Ista ratio ultima est apparens, sed prima
omni apparentia carere videtur quia secundum sacros
canones non est de aliquo inquisitio facienda nisi prius
fuerit diffamatus, ut habetur Extra, De accusationibus,
c. Qualiter et quando et in multis aliis locis; sed
theologi de haeresibus nullatenus diffamati fuerunt;
ergo de eis summi pontifices non debuerunt inquirere.

Student That last argument is clear; but the first
seems to lack all plausibility because according to the
sacred canons an inquisition should not be made into
anyone unless he has first been accused, as we find in
Extra, De accusationibus, c. Qualiter et quando
[col.745] and in many other places; but theologians
have not been accused about heresies; therefore,
highest pontiffs should not have made an inquisition
into them.

Magister Dicunt isti quod ista excusatio non est
sufficiens, quia, licet theologi non fuerint diffamati
quod essent haeretici, diffamabantur tamen quod
haereses docuerunt; unde et multi theologi nunc putant
quod alii theologi haereses dogmatizent quamvis
nollent asserere quod sint inter haereticos computandi.
Multi enim etiam forte cum assertione putant quod
omnes opiniones Thomae quae quondam fuerunt
damnatae Parisius sunt haereticae iudicandae. Nonnulli
etiam credunt omnes opiniones suas quas
Cantuarienses archiepiscopi damnaverunt inter
haereses computandas. Quidam enim firmissime
credunt quod dicere voluntatem nihil posse velle contra
actuale iudicium rationis sapiat haeresim manifestam
quia, ut dicunt, omne meritum tollit et demeritum.
Quidam etiam credunt quod dicere in homine non esse
nisi unam formam substantialem veritati obviat
orthodoxae. Quidam etiam putant quod multae
opiniones Scoti sint inter haereses numerandae. Dicere
enim quod sapienta Dei ab essentia Dei ex natura rei
quomodolibet distinguatur putant simplicitati divinae et
per consequens veritati catholicae repugnare. Idem
sentiunt de unitate minori, unitate numerali et
prioritatibus quas ponit in Deo et de aliis quae opinatur
quasi innumeris. Hoc idem de multis opinionibus
Egidii multi existimant. Est ergo notorium quod
theologi haereses dogmatizare notantur quamvis
haeretici minime reputentur. Propter talem ergo famam
debuerunt summi pontifices pro inquisitione facienda
moveri.

Master They say that that is not an adequate excuse,
because although theologians have not been accused
of having been heretics yet they were accused of
having taught heresies; so indeed many theologians
now think that other theologians teach heresies as
doctrine, even if they would not want to affirm that
they should be reckoned among heretics. For together
with this affirmation many also think perhaps that all
Thomas's opinions which were once condemned at
Paris should be judged as heretical. Some also believe
that all his opinions which the archbishops of
Canterbury condemned should be reckoned among the
heresies. For some people most firmly believe that to
say that the will can will nothing against the actual
judgement of reason smacks of manifest heresy,
because, as they say, it [this doctrine] takes away
every merit and demerit. Some people also believe
that to say that there is nothing in man except one
substantial form conflicts with orthodox truth. Some
people also think that many of Scotus's opinions
should be reckoned among the heresies. For they think
that to say that the wisdom of God may in some way
be distinguished in reality from the essence of God
contradicts the divine simplicity and, consequently,
conflicts with catholic truth. They think the same
about lesser unity, numeral unity and the priorities
which he locates in God and about practically
numberless other opinions he holds. Many think the
same about many of Egidius's [Giles of Rome's]
opinions. It is notorious therefore that theologians are
well known to teach heresies as doctrine, although
they are not regarded as heretics. Because of this
reputation, therefore, highest pontiffs ought to have
been moved to have had an inquiry made.

Discipulus Forte talis fama ad summos pontifices non
pervenit.

Student Perhaps such a reputation had not reached
the highest pontiffs.
