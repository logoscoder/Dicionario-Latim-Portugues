magis collegium cardinalium potest errare contra fidem.
Hic essent duo probanda, scilicet quod collegium
archiepiscoporum et episcoporum est eminencius
collegio cardinalium, quod ex hoc ostenditur, quod olim
cardinales Romane ecclesie ad archiepiscopatus electi et
assumpti fuerunt, secundum quod ex registro Innocencii
et gestis Romanorum pontificum habetur. Non debet
autem aliquis eligi de statu maiori ad minorem sed
econverso; ergo status archiepiscoporum est eminencior
statu cardinalium. Secundum probandum est quod
collegium seu communitas archiepiscoporum et
episcoporum potest contra fidem errare, quod patet ex
hoc quod Christus non promisit quod fides catholica
esset in episcopis usque ad finem seculi permansura.

bishops, can err against faith. It is therefore much
more the case that the college of cardinals can err
against faith. Here two things would have to be
proved, [firstly], that is, that the college of
archbishops and bishops is more eminent than the
college of cardinals, and this is shown from the fact
that at one time cardinals of the Roman church were
chosen and appointed to archbishoprics, according to
what is found in the register of Innocent and in the
deeds of the Roman pontiffs. No one should be
chosen from a greater position to a lesser one,
however, but the reverse. Therefore the position of
archbishop is more eminent than the position of
cardinal. Secondly, it has to be proved that the
college or community of archbishops and bishops can
err against faith. This is clear from the fact that Christ
did not promise that the catholic faith would remain
among bishops until the end of the age.

Undecimo sic: de una sola ecclesia militante dicitur
quod non potest errare contra fidem; collegium autem
cardinalium non est illa ecclesia, licet sit pars illius
ecclesie sicut et ecclesia Parisiensis est pars illius
ecclesie, quia congregacio fidelium est illa ecclesia que
non potest errare. Congregacio autem cardinalium non
est congregacio fidelium licet sit pars eius; ergo
congregacio cardinalium potest errare contra fidem.
Confirmatur hec racio quia quod competit toti ecclesie
non est attribuendum parti ecclesie, eciam principali,
nisi hoc possit per racionem necessariam vel
auctoritatem apertam ostendi. Collegium autem
cardinalium est pars ecclesie que errare non potest
contra fidem; ergo non posse errare contra fidem non
debet attribui collegio cardinalium, cum hoc nec per
racionem necessariam nec per auctoritatem apertam
possit ostendi.

[See Significant Variants, para. 31.]An eleventh
[argument is] as follows. It is said of only one church
militant that it can not err against faith. The college
of cardinals is not that church, however, although it is
part of that church, just as the church of Paris is also
part of that church, because it is the congregation of
believers that is the church that can not err. The
congregation of cardinals is not the congregation of
believers, however, although it is part of it. Therefore
the congregation of cardinals can err against faith.
This argument is confirmed because what belongs to
the whole church should not be attributed to part of
the church, even the main part, unless this can be
shown by necessary reason or by a plain authoritative
text. However the college of cardinals is part of the
church which can not err against faith. An inability to
err against faith, therefore, should not be attributed to
the college of cardinals since this can not be shown
by necessary reason or by a plain authoritative text.

Duodecimo sic: illud collegium quod contra fidem
errare non potest non indiget aliorum consilio pro
questionibus fidei terminandis; collegium autem
cardinalium sepe pro questionibus fidei terminandis
indiget aliorum consilio orthodoxorum, aliter enim pro
questionibus huiusmodi superfluum esset generalia
concilia celebrare; ergo collegium cardinalium potest
contra fidem errare.

A twelfth [argument is] the following. That college
which can not err against faith does not need the
advice of others in order to determine questions of
faith. The college of cardinals, however, often needs
the advice of other orthodox in order to determine
questions of faith, for otherwise it would be
superfluous to hold general councils for questions of
this kind. Therefore the college of cardinals can err
against faith.

Capitulum 8

Chapter 8

Discipulus Durum michi videtur asserere collegium
cardinalium posse contra fidem errare, tamen raciones
ad hoc inducte apparent difficiles. Quamobrem qualiter
ad raciones utriusque partis respondetur ostende, et
primo quomodo respondetur ad raciones pro prima
assercione.

Student: It seems hard to me to assert that the
college of cardinals can err against faith, yet the
arguments brought forward for it appear difficult [to
refure]. So show me how reply is made to the
arguments for both sides, and first how the arguments
for the first assertion are answered.
