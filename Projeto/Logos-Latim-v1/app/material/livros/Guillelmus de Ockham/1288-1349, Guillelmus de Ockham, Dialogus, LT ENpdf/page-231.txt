ante confirmacionem bonorum et casum malorum sic a
Deo extitit preservata quin quecumque pars illius tocius
multitudinis labi potuerit in peccatum et eternaliter
condemnari, licet Deus ordinaverit quod tota multitudo
angelorum nullatenus laberetur. Ergo consimiliter nulla
pars militantis ecclesie sic preservatur a Deo quin possit
contra fidem errare, licet Deus numquam permittet
totam militantem ecclesiam contra fidem errare.
Romana autem ecclesia est pars militantis ecclesie.
Ergo Romana ecclesia que est pars ecclesie potest
contra fidem errare.

good ones and the fall of the bad ones; but before the
confirmation of the good angels and the fall of the
bad, no part of the whole multitude of angels was so
kept safe by God that no part of that whole multitude
was unable to fall into sin and be eternally
condemned, although God ordained that the whole
multitude of angels would not fall. In a similar way,
therefore, no part of the church militant is so kept
safe by God that it can not err against faith, although
God will never permit the whole church militant to
err against faith. However the Roman church is part
of the church militant. Therefore the Roman church
that is part of the church militant can err against faith.

Capitulum 24

Chapter 24

Discipulus Licet firmiter teneam quod ecclesia Romana
contra fidem errare non possit secundum quod raciones
et auctoritates prius inducte probant aperte, tamen
quomodo asserentes Romanam ecclesiam posse contra
fidem errare respondent ad eas velis exponere. Cum
responsiones eorum ad ipsas irracionabiles esse
cognovero magis virtutem earum intelligam.

Student: Although I firmly maintain that the Roman
church can not err against faith, according to what the
arguments and texts brought forward above clearly
prove, would you nevertheless like to explain how
those who affirm that the Roman church can err
against faith reply to them. When I have learnt that
their replies to them are unreasonable I will better
understand their strength.

Replies to arguments that the Roman Church cannot err
Magister Ad primam earum respondent dicentes istam
esse falsam: illa ecclesia que voce evangelica Domini et
salvatoris nostri ceteris ecclesiis est prelata contra fidem
errare non potest. Nam ecclesia Anciochena ita fuit
ecclesiis aliis voce evangelica Domini et salvatoris
nostri prelata sicut Romana ecclesia, quia non invenitur
quod aliter Romana ecclesia voce salvatoris fuerit
prelata aliis ecclesiis nisi quia beatus Petrus a Domino
nostro cunctis prelatus fidelibus sedem tenebat in
Roma. Sed beatus Petrus primo sedem habebat
Anciochie et postea Rome. Ergo pro illo tempore quo
beatus Petrus sedit Anciochie ecclesia Anciochena voce
evangelica Domini et salvatoris nostri fuit cunctis
prelata ecclesiis, sicut postea Romana fuit cunctis
prelata ecclesiis. Sed ecclesia Anciochena non fuit
confirmata in fide sed errare potuit contra fidem. Ergo
non obstante quod ecclesia Romana voce evangelica
Domini et salvatoris nostri sit prelata ecclesiis universis,
ipsa tamen non est confirmata in fide sed contra fidem
posset errare. Et ideo dicunt quod temerarium est dicere
quod numquam errabit contra fidem, et eciam
temerarium est dicere quod errabit, quia utrunque est
nobis incognitum quia nec alterum eorum est revelatum
a Deo.

Master: They reply to the first of them by saying that
the following is false: that church which has been
preferred to other churches by the gospel word of our
Lord and Saviour can not err against faith. For the
Antioch church was preferred to other churches by
the gospel word of our Lord and Saviour just as the
Roman church was, because we do not find that the
Roman church was preferred to other churches by the
Saviour's word in any way except that blessed Peter,
having been set above the rest of the believers by our
Lord, had his see in Rome. But blessed Peter had his
see first in Antioch and later in Rome. For the time
when blessed Peter sat at Antioch, therefore, the
Antioch church was preferred to the rest of the
churches by the gospel word of our Lord and
Saviour, just as later the Roman church was preferred
to the rest of the churches. But the Antioch church
was not confirmed in faith but was able to err against
faith. Notwithstanding, therefore, that the Roman
church was preferred to all churches by the gospel
word of our Lord and Saviour, it was nevertheless not
confirmed in faith but was able to err against faith.
And they say, therefore, that it is rash to claim that it
will never err against faith, and also rash to claim that
it will so err, because each of these is unknown to us
since neither of them has been revealed by God.

Cum vero dicitur quod opus Dei ab hominibus dissolvi
non potest, respondent quod multa opera Dei ab
hominibus possunt dissolvi. Charitas enim et alie

But when it is said that the work of God can not be
destroyed by men, they reply that many works of
God can be destroyed by men. For charity and other
