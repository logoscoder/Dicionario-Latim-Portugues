non possit recuperari absque nova collatione
eiusdem iuris. Nam ius eligendi summum
pontificem est ius spirituale, ut isti dicunt, et
tamen si Romani efficerentur haeretici non
amitterent illud ius {*trs. &NaPeRe} quia tunc
ipsis redeuntibus de haeresi {*trs.231 &NaRe}
non recuperarent ius eligendi per rationem
praedictam.

For the right to elect the supreme pontiff is a
spiritual right, they say, and yet the Romans
would not lose that right if they were to
become heretics, because then, by the above
argument, they would not recover the right to
elect if they return from their heresy.

Similiter si Romani et cardinales omnes qui
habent ius eligendi efficerentur haeretici ius
eligendi illa vice devolveretur ad alios
catholicos. Quo posito, ponatur {ponitur &Pe}
iterum quod omnes alii {om. &Na} Christiani
efficiantur haeretici praeter decem. Quo posito,
omnes Christiani praeter illos {om. &Pe}
decem amitterent ius {om. &Mz} eligendi
summum pontificem. Quo posito, de
Christianis haereticis {om. &Pe} redeant ad
fidem catholicam 20 et illi {*om.
&NaMzPeRe} 10 qui prius erant {*soli add.
&NaPeRe} catholici {sibi add. &Mz} labantur
{labuntur &Pe} in haeresim, tunc quaeritur an
isti 20 reversi de haeresi habent {habeant &Pe}
ius eligendi summum pontificem aut non
habeant {*habent &MzNaRe} {om. &Pe}. Si
habent ius eligendi, ergo absque nova
collatione recuperaverunt {om. &Pe} ius
spirituale quod prius amiserant per haereticam
pravitatem {recuperant add. &Pe}. Si non
habent ius eligendi, ergo tota ecclesia Dei esset
privata iure eligendi summum pontificem, et
per consequens Christus non in omnibus
necessariis sufficienter {sufficit &NaRe}
[[corrected interlinear Re]] providit
{*providisset &NaPeRe} ecclesiae.

Similarly, if the Romans and all the cardinals
who have the right to elect were to become
heretics, the right to elect would devolve on
that occasion to other catholics. Given this
assumption, let it be assumed further that all
other christians except ten become heretics.
Given this assumption, all christians except
those ten would lose the right to elect the
supreme pontiff. Given this assumption, let
twenty of the heretical christians return to the
catholic faith and let the ten who were
previously the only catholics slip into heresy;
it is then asked whether those twenty who
have returned from heresy have the right to
elect the supreme pontiff or do not have [the
right]. If they have the right to elect, they
have therefore recovered without its being
conferred anew a spiritual right which they
had lost before by heretical wickedness. If
they do not have the right to elect, the whole
church of God would therefore be deprived of
the right to elect a supreme pontiff, and,
consequently, Christ would not have
sufficiently provided for the church in
everything that was necessary.

Item ius patronatus est {ius add. &Mz}
ecclesiae et {*ecclesiae et om. &NaRe} ius
spirituale et tamen quamvis amittatur per
haereticam pravitatem absque nova collatione
poterit recuperari. Nam si aliquis patronus fiat
haereticus amittit ius patronatus. Sed si retineat
rem ratione cuius est patronus et redierit ad
fidei veritatem recuperat ius patronatus quod
amiserat, quia, {*si add. &NaMzPeRe} ius
patronatus transit cum universitate, multo

Again, the right of patronage is a spiritual
right, and yet even if it is lost through
heretical wickedness it will be able to be
recovered without its being conferred anew.
For any patron who becomes a heretic loses
the right of patronage. But if he retains the
possession with respect to which he is a
patron and returns to the true faith, he
recovers the right of patronage which he had
lost, because, if the right of patronage passes
