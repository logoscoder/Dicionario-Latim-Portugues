Discipulus Aliam rationem adducas ad idem.

Student Would you bring forward another
argument for the same [opinion].

Magister Alia ratio talis est. Sancti canonizati
ab ecclesia non sunt credendi existere {*om.
&NaPeRe} in peccato mortali aut in rebellione
damnabili vel alia {*aliqua &NaRe} iniuria
decessisse. Sed plures fuerunt sancti reges et
alii qui imperatorem minime recognoverunt
superiorem in temporalibus et {om. &Re} in
hoc finierunt dies suos; exemplum de sancto
Ludovico rege Francorum et pluribus regibus
Angliae. Igitur {*ergo &MzNaRe} vere non
fuerunt subditi {*subiecti &MzNaPeRe}
Romano imperio.

Master [2] Another argument is as follows.
Saints canonised by the church should not
be believed to have given way to mortal sin
or blameworthy rebellion or any wrong.
But there have been many saintly kings and
others who have not recognised the
emperor as their superior in temporal
affairs and have finished their days with
this opinion. Examples are St. Louis king
of the Franks and many kings of England.
Therefore they truly were not subject to the
Roman empire.

Discipulus Forte dicerent alii quod isti {*illi
&MzNaRe} sancti {*viri add. &NaRe}
nesciverunt {nescierunt &Mz} se esse {*om.
&NaRe} subiectos {subiecti &Pe} Romano
imperio et si scivissent hoc {de vero de add.
&Pe} [[margin]] facto et {in &Re} {om. &Na}
verbo {et verbo om. &Pe} recognovissent.
Quare per ignorantiam iuris {talis add. &Pe}
civilis poterant {poterunt &Mz} {*potuerunt
&NaRe} excusari.

Student Perhaps others would say that
those saintly men did not know that they
were subject to the Roman empire and if
they had known this they would have
recognised it in deed and in word. They
could be excused, therefore, through
ignorance of the civil law.

Magister Apparet aliis quod haec {ista &Pe}
responsio non sufficit, quia reges et principes
tenentur scire an habeant superiorem vel non
{*habeant add. &MzNaPeRe}. Ignorantia
autem {om. &Pe} iuris {*illius &MzNaPeRe}
quod quis tenetur scire {trs. &Pe} non excusat,
1, q. 4, sed {*para. &MzNaRe} {c. &Pe}
Notandum. Igitur {*ergo &MzNaRe} reges et
principes per talem ignorantiam nullatenus
fuerunt {*trs. &MzNaRe} excusati {accusati
&Re}.

Master It appears to some that this reply is
not adequate, because kings and princes are
bound to know whether they have a
superior or not. Moreover, ignorance of that
which someone is bound to know does not
excuse (1, q. 4, para. Notandum {c.12,
col.422]. Therefore kings and princes are
not excused by such ignorance.

Discipulus Forte dicerent aliqui quod reges illi
et principes non tenebantur habere tantam
peritiam iurium civilium et historiarum ut
cognoscerent se subiectos Romano imperio.

Student Perhaps some people would say
that those kings and princes were not bound
to have such knowledge of civil law and
history as to know that they were subject to
