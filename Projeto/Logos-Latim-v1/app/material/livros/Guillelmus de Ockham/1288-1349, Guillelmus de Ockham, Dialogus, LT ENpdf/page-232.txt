virtutes infuse viatori sunt opera Dei, et tamen per
liberum arbitrium dissolvi possunt, quia habens primo
charitatem et virtutes potest peccare mortaliter. Per
peccatum autem mortale caritas expellitur. Sic dicunt de
Romana ecclesia quod licet in beato Petro acceperit
principatum, tota tamen Roma potest ab infidelibus
usque ad finem seculi occupari. Nec scitur an infideles
totam Romam sint umquam capturi usque ad finem
seculi retenturi. Posset eciam tota Roma et omnes
Christiani in ipsa ad aliam sectam converti. Nec scit
aliquis, nisi cui Deus revelasset, an tota Roma tempore
Antichristi convertetur ad ipsum; ymmo nescitur an
aliquando tota Roma et omnes habitantes in ipsa
convertentur ad sectam Machometi vel ad aliquam
aliam hereticam pravitatem.

virtues infused in a pilgrim are works of God and yet
they can be destroyed by free will because someone
who at first has charity and virtues can sin mortally.
Charity is driven out by mortal sin however. In this
way they say of the Roman church that although it
received dominion in [the person of] blessed Peter,
the whole of Rome can nevertheless be occupied by
unbelievers until the end of the age. Nor is it known
whether unbelievers will ever capture the whole of
Rome and keep it until the end of the age. The whole
of Rome and all the Christians in it could also be
converted to another sect. Nor does anyone know,
unless God has revealed it to someone, whether in the
time of anti-Christ the whole of Rome will be
converted to him; indeed it is not known whether the
whole of Rome and everyone living in it will be
converted to the sect of Mohammed or to some other
heretical wickedness.

Cum autem in eadem racione accipitur quod si illa
ecclesia que voce divina ceteris ecclesiis est prelata
contra fidem erraret desineret esse caput aliarum
ecclesiarum, respondent quod si tota Roma
converteretur ad sectam Sarracenorum vel ad aliam
hereticam pravitatem et papa et omnes cardinales et
omnes clerici Rome titulos habentes in pravitatem
hereticam laberentur, adhuc posset dici quod Romana
ecclesia aliquo modo non desineret esse caput aliarum
ecclesiarum, non quod tunc de facto esset aliquis papa
vel aliquod collegium aut aliqua persona extra omnem
aliam ecclesiam particularem qui vel quod vel que esset
caput aliarum ecclesiarum, sed quia eligendus esset
summus pontifex per catholicos, quando possent
convenienter, qui pater esset omnium catholicorum et
de iure licet non de facto sedem Rome tenere deberet,
quemadmodum nunc creantur patriarche Alexandrinus,
Anciochenus et Hierosolymitanus qui de iure in
predictis civitatibus sedere deberent. Et ideo
quemadmodum
nunc
dicitur
quod
ecclesia
Constantinopolitana est secunda ecclesia post Romanam
et Alexandrina tercia et Anciochena quarta et
Hierosolymitana quinta, quia si civitates predicte essent
a fidelibus occupate prefate ecclesie talem ordinem
haberent, et de facto patriarche a predictis civitatibus
appellati quando creantur talem ordinem retinent inter
se, ita si omnes Romani essent aversi a fide adhuc
summus pontifex esset fidelium caput, et, si Roma
converteretur ad fidem, deberet primitatem respectu
aliarum ecclesiarum habere.

When it is assumed in the same argument, however,
that if that church which has been preferred to the
rest of the churches by divine word were to err
against faith it would cease to be head of the other
churches, they reply that if the whole of Rome were
converted to the sect of the Saracens or to some other
heretical wickedness and the pope, all the cardinals
and all the clergy having titular churches in Rome
were to fall into heretical wickedness it could still be
said that in some way the Roman church did not
cease to be head of the other churches. This is not
because there would then in fact be some pope or
some college or some person outside every other
particular church who or which would be the head of
other churches, but because a highest pontiff would
be bound to be chosen by catholics, when they could
do so conveniently, and he would be father of all
catholics and by right, although not in fact, should
hold the see of Rome, just as patriarchs are now
appointed for Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem
who by right ought to have their see in those cities.
And therefore just as it is now said that the church of
Constantinople is the second church after the Roman
one, the church of Alexandria the third, the church of
Antioch the fourth and the church of Jerusalem the
fifth, because if those cities were occupied by
believers their churches would have that order, and
the patriarchs named after those cities when they are
appointed in fact retain that order among themselves,
so if all the Romans were turned away from the faith
the highest pontiff would still be the head of
believers and, if Rome were converted to the faith, he
should have preeminence with respect to other
churches.

Discipulus Si tota Roma esset ab infidelibus occupata
vel ad aliam sectam conversa, nunquid secundum istos
oporteret creare clericos loco priorum qui fuerunt

Student: If the whole of Rome were occupied by
unbelievers or converted to another sect, would it be
proper, according to them, to appoint clergy in place
of the earlier ones who had been at Rome, in the
