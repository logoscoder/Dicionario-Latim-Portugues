convenientem non se corrigeret esset pertinax
reputandus. Si vero est literatus, sciens quos libros
ecclesia reputat esse de integritate Novi et Veteris
Testamenti, et tamen hoc non obstante diceret librum
Iosue vel alium ad Vetus Testamentum minime
pertinere esset statim haereticus et pertinax iudicandus,
nec esset expectandus ut se correctus corrigeret, sed
statim pro incorrigibili esset habendus.

instructed. If he were not to correct himself after
appropriate teaching he should be regarded as
pertinacious. But if he is learned and knows what
books the church regards as integral to the New and
Old Testament and yet, notwithstanding this, were to
say that the book of Joshua, or some other, does not
belong to the Old Testament he should be condemned
immediately as a heretic and pertinacious; nor should
he be waited on so that once corrected he might then
correct himself, but he should be held at once to be
incorrigible.

Secundus autem, qui scilicet dicit aliquam partem Novi
vel Veteris Testamenti non esse recipiendam vel
aliquod falsum asserere, sive literatus sive illiteratus
extiterit, est statim pertinax iudicandus, nisi forte fuerit
adeo simplex quod nesciat quid per "Novum et Vetus
Testamentum" importetur et, seductus ab aliis, dicat
Novum vel Vetus Testamentum aut aliquam partem
recipi non debere, firmiter tamen credens totam fidem
ecclesiae esse recipiendam. Talis enim non est inter
haereticos computandus sed per simplicitatem et
ignorantiam excusandus. Et de talibus simplicibus dicit
Augustinus, ut habetur 24. q. 3. c. Haereticus, "Ille
autem qui huiusmodi hominibus," scilicet haereticis,
"credit imaginatione quadam veritatis est illusus." Et
ideo non videtur quod debeat pertinax iudicari nisi
credat fidem ecclesiae esse falsam vel alio modo
pertinax convincatur.

However, in the second case, namely someone who
says that some part of the New or Old Testament
should not be accepted or that it asserts something
false, he should be judged immediately as
pertinacious, whether he is learned or unlearned,
unless perhaps he is so simple that he does not know
what is meant by "New and Old Testament" and, led
astray by others, says that the New or Old Testament
or some part of it should not be accepted even though
he firmly believes that the whole faith of the church
should be accepted. For such a person should not be
counted among the heretics but should be excused by
simplicity and ignorance. It is about such simple
people that Augustine speaks, as we read in 24. q. 3.
c. Hereticus [col.998], "He who believes men of this
kind," that is heretics, "has been deceived by some
fancy of truth." It does not seem, therefore, that he
should be judged as pertinacious unless he believes
that the faith of the church is false or is convicted as
pertinacious in another way.

Capitulum 7

Chapter 7

Discipulus Circa istum modum de pertinacia
convincendi nolo multum insistere quia non audio quod
illi inter quos modo controversia vertitur aliquid tale
mutuo sibi imponant nec aliquis alteri. Unum tamen
retulisti quod peto declarari quia forte utile erit ad
multa eo quod ad multa genera haereticorum applicari
poterit ut videtur. Dixisti namque quod si aliquis sciret
quos libros Ecclesia reputat de integritate Novi et
Veteris Testamenti et tamen hoc non obstante diceret
quod aliquem eorum ad Novum vel Vetus
Testamentum minime pertinere esset statim pertinax et
haereticus iudicandus nec esset expectandus an
correctus paratus esset se corrigere sed statim pro
incorrigibili esset habendus. De hoc enim ultimo miror
quomodo talis sit statim incorrigibilis reputandus. Qui
enim corrigi potest non est incorrigibilis. Talis autem
corrigi potest. Ergo non est incorrigibilis reputandus.

Disciple I do not want particularly to pursue that way
of convicting of pertinacity because I do not hear that
those who are now engaged in controversy attribute
any such thing to each other mutually, nor does
anyone [of them accuse] any other. You have,
however, referred to one thing which I want to be
explained because it will be beneficial perhaps to
many [problems], in that it can be applied, it seems, to
many kinds of heretics. For you said that if someone
were to know what books the church regards as
integral to the New and Old Testament and yet,
notwithstanding this, were to say that any one of them
does not belong to the New or Old Testament he
should be judged immediately as pertinacious and a
heretic and he should not be waited on [to see]
whether, once corrected, he would be ready to correct
himself but he should be held at once to be
incorrigible. For I wonder about this last point, how
such a person should be regarded at once as
incorrigible; for he who can be corrected is not
incorrigible; but such a person can be corrected; he
should not be regarded, therefore, as incorrigible.
