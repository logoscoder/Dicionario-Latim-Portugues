&Re}, et per consequens ius eligendi quod eis
competit ratione cardinalatus amittunt. Sed
papa si est fautor haereticorum ipso facto seu
iure a papatu deponitur. Ergo et {om. &Na}
cardinales propter favorem haereticorum iure
eligendi privantur.

from his papal dignity, and as a consequence
they lose the right to elect which belongs to
them by virtue of their cardinalship. But if the
pope is a supporter of heretics he is in fact or
in law deposed from the papacy. Cardinals
too, therefore, are deprived of their right to
elect because of support for heretics.

Maior videtur probatione minime indigere.
Minor {om. &Mz} [[gap left]] exemplo
probatur. Nam Anastasius secundus propter
favorem haereticorum fuit depositus. Non
enim legitur de ipso nisi quod faverit Fotino et
Achacio haereticis. Nam in decretis 19 {?3
&Re} dist. {*trs. &NaRe} Anastasius {om.
&MzNaRe} sic habetur, "Anastasius secundus
{om. &MzNaRe}, natione Romanus, fuit
temporibus Theodrici regis. Eodem tempore
multi clerici se a communione ipsius abegerunt
eo quod communicasset sine consilio
episcoporum vel {prelatorum vel add. &Mz}
presbyterorum et clericorum cunctae
{occasione &Mz} ecclesiae catholicae diacono
Thessalonicensi, nomine {om. &NaRe}
Fotino, qui communicaverat Achatio, et {om.
&NaRe} quia voluit occulte revocare
Achatium et non potuit nutu divino {trs.
&MzNaRe} percussus est." In quibus verbis
non habetur nisi quod Anastasius favit Fotino
et Achatio, et tamen fuit depositus. Ergo
propter favorem haereticorum papa deponitur.

The major [premise] does not seem to need
proof. The minor is proved by an example.
For Anastasius II was deposed because of
support for heretics. For all we read about
him is that he supported the heretics Fotinus
and Achacius. For we find the following in
the decretals at dist. 19, c. Anastasius [c.9,
col.64], "Anastasius II, of Roman stock, lived
in the times of King Theodoric. At that time
many clerics withdrew from communion with
him because without consultation with the
bishops, priests and clerics of the whole
catholic church he had communicated with a
deacon of Thessalonica named Fotinus, who
had communicated with Achatius, and,
because he wanted secretly to recall Achatius
and could not do so, he was struck by divine
command." We find nothing in these words
except that Anastasius supported Fotinus and
Achatius, and yet he was deposed. Therefore
a pope is deposed because of support for
heretics.

Opinion 4: Or if the cardinals are in schism

Aliter respondetur quod cardinales non solum
propter haeresim et favorem haereticae
pravitatis vel {*et &NaRe} haereticorum sed
etiam propter schisma privantur iure eligendi
summum pontificem.

Another reply is that it is not only because of
heresy and the support of heretical
wickedness and heretics that cardinals are
deprived of the right to elect the supreme
pontiff, but also because of schism.

Hoc taliter videtur posse probari. quia {*om.
&NaRe} Qui nihil potestatis aut iuris habet
non habet potestatem {*ius &NaRe} eligendi
summum pontificem. neque ius {*neque ius
om. &NaRe}. Sed {om. &Mz} cardinales si
efficiantur schismatici nihil iuris aut potestatis

This seems provable as follows. He who has
no power or right does not have the right to
elect the supreme pontiff. But if cardinals
become schismatics they have no right or
power, as Cyprian attest. We find in 24, q. 1,
c. Dicimus [c.31, col.977] that he says, as was

939
