CAN THE CARDINALS BECOME HERETICS?
Magister De hoc sunt opiniones contrarie. Nam aliqui
arbitrantur quod totum collegium cardinalium hereticari
non potest, et istius opinionis videtur esse frater G. qui,
ut a quibusdam Fratrum Minorum audivi, hoc in
quodam processu facto Perpeniani contra fratrem M.
asserit manifeste. Pro hac autem assercione modis
multis arguitur.

Master: There are conflicting opinions about this.
For some people think that it is not possible for the
whole college of cardinals to become heretics and
brother G[erald Ot] seems to be of this opinion. He
clearly asserts this, as I have heard from some Friars
Minor, in the legal proceedings at Perpignan directed
against brother M[ichael]. There are many arguments
for this assertion.

That the Cardinals can not become heretics
Primo sic: ecclesia Romana hereticari non potest: 24, q.
1, c. Pudenda et c. A recta et c. Memor ubi dicit Sixtus
papa, "Memor sum me sub illius nomine presidere
ecclesie cuius confessio a Domino Iesu glorificata est et
cuius fides nullam heresim umquam fovet sed omnes
quidem hereses destruit." Ista autem ecclesia cui prefuit
Sixtus fuit Romana ecclesia; ergo Romana ecclesia
hereticari non potest; sed ista Romana ecclesia non est
papa, quia papa preest Romane ecclesie; nullus autem
sibiipsi preesse potest; ergo papa non est Romana
ecclesia que hereticari non potest. Nec universalis
ecclesia est Romana ecclesia, quia Romana ecclesia est
magister aliarum ecclesiarum et caput; universalis
autem ecclesia non est caput aliarum ecclesiarum sed
est totum corpus. Nec potest dici quod Romana ecclesia
est populus Romanus vel clerus cum populo vel totus
clerus comprehendens collegium cardinalium tanquam
partem; nam ad Romanam ecclesiam spectat de aliis
ecclesiis ordinare, sicut ex sacris canonibus colligitur
evidenter; hoc autem non pertinet ad populum
Romanum nec ad clerum et populum nec ad totum
clerum Romanum qui comprehendit collegium
cardinalium tanquam partem. Ergo per ecclesiam
Romanam solummodo collegium cardinalium debet
intelligi, et per consequens idem collegium hereticari
non potest.

The first is as follows. The Roman church can not
become heretical: 24, q. 1, c. Pudenda [col.978] and
c. A recta [col.969] and c. Memor, where pope Sixtus
says[col.969], "I am mindful that I preside in the
name of that church whose confession has been
glorified by the Lord Jesus and whose faith never
fosters any heresy but in fact destroys all heresies."
The church that Sixtus ruled, however, was the
Roman church; therefore it is not possible for the
Roman church to become heretical. But that Roman
church is not the pope because the pope rules over
the Roman church; however, no one can rule over
himself. Therefore the pope is not the Roman church
which can not become heretical. Nor is the universal
church the Roman church because the Roman church
is the chief and head of the other churches. The
universal church, however, is not the head of the
other churches but is the whole body. Nor can it be
said that the Roman church is the Roman people nor
the clergy with the people nor the whole clergy
which contains the college of cardinals as part. For it
pertains to the Roman church to make arrangements
about other churches, as we clearly gather from the
sacred canons. This does not pertain, however, to the
Roman people, nor to the clergy and people, nor to
the whole Roman clergy which contains the college
of cardinals as part. Therefore the college of
cardinals only should be understood by the Roman
church, and consequently that college can not
become heretical.

Secundo sic: sedes apostolica hereticari non potest, teste
Eusebio papa qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. In sede, ait, "In
sede apostolica extra maculam semper est catholica
servata religio." Sedes autem apostolica non est papa
qui presidet apostolice sedi, nec est populus Romanus,
nec clerus cum populo, nec totus clerus. Ergo est
collegium cardinalium, et per consequens collegium
cardinalium hereticari non potest.

A second [argument is] as follows. The apostolic see
can not become heretical, as Pope Eusebius attests.
As we find in 24, q. 1, c. In sede, he says [col.969],
"The catholic religion has always been preserved
without stain in the apostolic see." But the apostolic
see is not the pope who presides over the apostolic
see, nor is it the Roman people, nor the clergy with
the people, nor the whole of the clergy. It is,
therefore, the college of cardinals; and as a
consequence the college of cardinals can not become
heretical.

Tercio sic. Illud collegium quod solummodo et non

A third [argument is] as follows. That college which
