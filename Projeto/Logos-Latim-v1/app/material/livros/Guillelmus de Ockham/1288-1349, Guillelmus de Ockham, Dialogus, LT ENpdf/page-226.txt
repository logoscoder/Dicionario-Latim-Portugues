debent intelligi, quia fides catholica in ecclesia Romana
vel in ecclesia Pisana vel in alia usque ad finem seculi
permanebit. Semper enim erit aliquis catholicus et
fidelis.

church but should be understood as part of a
disjunction and in general concerning the Roman
church and other [churches], because the catholic
faith will remain until the end of the age in the
Roman church or in the Pisan church or in some
other church. For there will always be someone who
is a believing catholic.

Tercia racio eorum est hec. Ecclesia Romana postquam
inchoata fuit potuit contra fidem errare; igitur adhuc
potest errare contra fidem. Antecedens patet quia ante
adventum beati Petri Romam ecclesia inchoata ibidem
potuit errare contra fidem, non enim tunc magis erat
confirmata in fide quam alie ecclesie. Consequencia
patet quia non legitur quod in fide fuerit postea
confirmata. Ergo temerarium est asserere quod errare
non potuerit.

Their third argument is this. After it began the
Roman church was able to err against faith; therefore
it is still able to err against faith. The antecedent is
clear because before the arrival in Rome of blessed
Peter the church which had begun there was able to
err against faith. For it had not been more confirmed
in faith at that time than other churches. The
consequence is clear because we do not read that it
was afterwards confirmed in faith. It is rash to assert,
therefore, that it could not err.

Discipulus Videtur quod ex quo apostoli Petrus et
Paulus consecraverunt et fundaverunt Romanam
ecclesiam errare non potuit.

Student: It seems that because the apostles Peter and
Paul founded and consecrated the Roman church it
was not able to err.

Magister Hoc non videtur secundum istos veritatem
habere, quia apostoli Petrus et Paulus non aliter
fundaverunt Romanam ecclesiam nisi Romanos in fide
sollicite instruendo, et eos ad fidem et bona opera
doctrina et exemplis hortando, doctrinamque suam
miraculis confirmando, et tandem civitatem Romanam
suo martirio consecrando. Sed predicta omnia fecit
Christus Hierosolymitane ecclesie, quia ipsam
diligenter in fide instruxit ipsamque ad fidem et bona
opera doctrina exemplis et miraculis hortabatur; pro qua
eciam, sicut et ceteris, mortem accepit, et sic
Hierosolymam sua morte et passione consecravit. Et
tamen per omnia ista ecclesia Hierosolymitana in fide
minime extitit confirmata, cum tamen opera, doctrina,
vita et mors Christi multo maioris efficacie fuerint
quam opera, vita, doctrina et martirium apostolorum
Petri et Pauli. Petrus eciam et alii apostoli fundaverunt
ecclesiam Anciochenam. Beatus eciam Paulus plures
fundavit ecclesias. Alii eciam apostoli alias ecclesias
suo martirio consecraverunt, et tamen nulla earum in
fide extitit confirmata. Ergo consimiliter nichil apparet
fuisse factum in Romana ecclesia unde in fide reputari
debeat confirmata. Multa enim maiora ad stabilimentum
fidei facta fuerunt Hierosolymis et in Iudea quam in
Roma. Si ergo nec Hierosolyma nec Iudea fuit in fide
confirmata, temerarium est dicere quod ecclesia
Romana confirmata sit in fide.

Master: This does not seem to be true according to
them, because the apostles Peter and Paul founded
the Roman church only by instructing the Romans
carefully in faith, by encouraging them to faith and
good works by teaching and examples, by confirming
their teaching with miracles and, finally, by
consecrating the city of Rome by their own
martyrdom. But Christ did all those things for the
church of Jerusalem because he diligently instructed
it in faith and encouraged it to faith and good works
by teaching, examples and miracles; he also accepted
death on its behalf, as on behalf of the rest too, and in
this way consecrated Jerusalem by his death and
passion. And yet the Jerusalem church was not
confirmed in faith by all these [acts] despite the
work, teaching, life and death of Christ being of
greater efficacy than the work, life, teaching and
martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul. In addition
Peter and other apostles founded the church of
Antioch. Blessed Paul also founded many churches.
Other apostles consecrated other churches too by
their martyrdom, and yet none of them was
confirmed in faith. Similarly, therefore, nothing
seems to have been done in the Roman church as a
result of which it should be regarded as confirmed in
faith. For many greater things were done for the
support of faith at Jerusalem and in Judea than in
Rome. If therefore neither Jerusalem nor Judea was
confirmed in faith it is rash to say that the Roman
church has been confirmed in faith.

Unde et ex hoc quarta racio sic formatur. Non magis
fuit electa a Deo ecclesia Romana quam ecclesia
Hierosolymitana; sed Deus permisit ecclesiam

And so from this [point] the fourth argument is also
fashioned as follows. The Roman church was not
more chosen by God than was the Jerusalem church;
