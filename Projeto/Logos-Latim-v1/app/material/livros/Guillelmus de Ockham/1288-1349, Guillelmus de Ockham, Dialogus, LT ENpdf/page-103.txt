illum qui dubitat de aliqua veritate catholica in speciali.
Talis autem in fide dubius est pertinax seu pertinaciter
dubitans quia talis non est paratus corrigi per fidem
christianam. Nullus enim paratus est corrigi per
doctrinam quam dubitat esse veram, cum nullus nisi
per veritatem corrigi velit. Ille autem qui dubitat de
aliquo articulo speciali potest esse paratus corrigi per
fidem christianam quia per Scripturam Sacram quam
totam credit esse veram, licet dubitet de aliquo speciali,
nesciens illud in sacris literis inveniri. Et ideo non est
statim pertinax reputandus. Aliter est de illo qui in
genere vel in universali dubitat fidem esse veram. Et de
tali dubio in fide loquuntur glossae, quarum una 24, q.
3, super para. Quia vero ait, "Uno modo dicitur
haereticus quicunque est dubius in fide." Et alia eisdem
causa et q. super c. Aperte ait, "Nota haereticum esse
titubantem in fide." Et post, "Nam et haereticorum
vocabulo continetur qui levi etiam argumento a fide
deviat." Omnes enim loquuntur de illo qui dubitat
fidem christianam esse veram.

some particular catholic truth. Such a doubter in the
faith, however, is pertinacious or is doubting
pertinaciously because such a person is not ready to
be corrected by the christian faith. For no one is ready
to be corrected by teaching that he doubts is true,
since no one wants to be corrected except by the truth.
He who doubts some particular article, however, can
be ready to be corrected by the christian faith because
[he is ready to be corrected] by sacred scripture, the
whole of which he believes to be true, although he
doubts some particular [article], not knowing that it is
found in the sacred writings. And so he should not
immediately be considered pertinacious. It is
otherwise with him who doubts in general or as a
whole that the faith is true. And it is about such a
doubter in the faith that the glosses speak, one of
which, on 24, q. 3, para. Quia vero [col.1427], says,
"In one way a heretic is said be anyone who is
doubtful of the faith." The other [gloss], on c. Aperte
[col.1404] in the same causa and quaestio, says, "Note
that a heretic is one who is unsteady in faith. ... For
also comprehended by the word "heretics" is he who
deviates from the faith even by a slight argument."
For they are all speaking about him who doubts that
christian faith is true.

Discipulus Miror quod non plus oportet dubitantem de
fide esse pertinacem quam dubitantem de aliquo
articulo speciali, praesertim cum ita possit quis absque
pertinacia dubitare de universali sicut de singulari.

Student I wonder that it is not more necessary for one
doubting the faith to be pertinacious than for one
doubting some particular article, especially since
anyone can in this way doubt without pertinacity a
universal, just as he can a singular.

Magister De hoc non reputant isti mirandum. Sicut
enim inter propositiones est ordo, quia alia est prior et
alia posterior, una etiam sit nota per aliam et saepe non
econverso. Et ideo qui de propositione simpliciter
prima in aliquo ordine, quae nullo modo posset fieri
nota per aliam, dubitaret non esset praesumendum
quod unquam ad illius notitiam esset venturus, licet si
dubitaret
de
propositione
posteriori
esset
praesumendum quod ad eius notitiam per propositiones
priores posset attingere. Sic quia primum quod oportet
fidelem credere est quod fides christiana est vera, si de
hoc quis dubitat nihil remanet per quod ad firmiter
credendum valeat revocari. Et ideo taliter dubitans
tanquam pertinax et nolens corrigi est censendus. Si
autem nullatenus dubitat fidem christianam esse veram,
licet dubitet de aliquo articulo speciali, praesumendum
est, nisi contrarium manifeste appareat, quod si sibi
ostensum fuerit articulum de quo dubitat ad fidem
pertinere catholicam absque mora se corriget.

Master They do not regard this as something to be
wondered at, for just as there is an order among
propositions, because one is prior and the other
posterior, one may be also known through the other
with the converse often not the case. And therefore it
should not be presumed of someone who was to doubt
a proposition that was simply first in some system of
ordering and which could in no way become known
through another [proposition], that he would ever
come to a knowledge of it, although if he were to
doubt some posterior proposition it should be
presumed that he could arrive at knowledge of it
through prior propositions. Thus because the first
thing that it behoves a believer to believe is that the
christian faith is true, if anyone were to doubt this,
nothing remains though which he can be recalled to
firm belief, and so someone doubting in this way
should be considered as pertinacious and refusing to
be corrected. If he does not doubt that the christian
faith is true, however, even if he doubts some
particular article it should be presumed, unless the
contrary is clearly apparent, that he will correct
himself without delay if it is shown to him that the
article which he doubts does pertain to catholic faith.
