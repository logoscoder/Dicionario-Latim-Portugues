isti nomen ecclesie solummodo accipi in Scriptura
Divina. Et ideo dicunt quod ad ecclesiam, secundum
quod in Scriptura Divina que est tocius fidei catholice
fundamentum accipitur, ita laici et mulieres pertinent et
sunt persone ecclesiastice sicut clerici.

which is known to include within it the company of
catholics, should be built without the pope's
injunction?" Here 'church' is taken as a gathering of
catholics, which does not exclude women or laymen.
They say that the word 'church' is taken in divine
scripture only in the above two senses. And therefore
they say that laymen and women belong to the
church, as that is taken in divine scripture which is
the basis of the whole of catholic faith, and are
ecclesiastical personages just like the clergy.

In iure autem canonico hoc nomen ecclesia
significaciones habet alias a predictis, quia clerici
nomen ecclesie ad clericos restrinxerunt, clericos
solummodo vocantes ecclesiam. Cum tamen, sicut
dictum est, secundum quod Scriptura Divina utitur
nomine ecclesie ita sint persone ecclesiastice laici et
mulieres sicut clerici, ita sunt de ecclesia sicut clerici.
Et sic accipiendo ecclesiam solummodo pro clericis,
habet adhuc plures significaciones, secundum quod
notat glossa Extra, De verborum significacione c.
Clerici [s.v. ecclesia Placentina, col. 1942], quia
"quandoque designat tantum episcopum (7, q. 1, c.
Scire), quandoque ponitur pro maori parte capituli (56,
dist. c. Apostolica), quandoque restringitur ad canonicos
matricis ecclesie (63. dist. para. ultimo et 10, q. 1, c.
Antiquos), quandoque designat quamlibet ecclesiam
provincie (Extra De usu pallii, c. Cum super)".

In canon law, however, this word 'church' has other
senses apart from the above because the clergy have
restricted the word 'church' to the clergy, calling only
them the church. (Nevertheless since, as has been
said, according to the way divine scripture uses the
word 'church' laymen and women are ecclesiastical
personages as are the clergy, so they are part of the
church like the clergy.) And if we take 'church' in this
way only for the clergy, it still has several senses,
according to what the gloss on Extra, De verborum
significatione, c. [Cum] clerici notes [s.v. ecclesia
Placentina, col. 1942], because "sometimes it
denotes only a bishop (7, q. 1, c. Scire), sometimes it
is used for the greater part of a Chapter (dist. 56, c.
Apostolica), sometimes it is restricted to canons of a
mother church (dist. 63, last para. and 10, q. 1, c.
Antiquos), sometimes it denotes any church in a
province (Extra, De usu pallii, c. Cum super)".

Per hoc respondent isti ad racionem primam, dicentes
quod aliqua ecclesia potest contra fidem errare, et aliqua
ecclesia non potest contra fidem errare. Clerici autem
sunt illa ecclesia que potest errare, sed non sunt illa
ecclesia que non potest errare, licet si sint catholici sint
pars illius ecclesie que non potest errare. Quod vero sit
aliqua ecclesia que potest hereticari auctoritate beati
Ambrosii probare nituntur. Ait enim Ambrosius, ut
recitatur 24, q. 1, c. Que dignior, "Si qua est ecclesia
que fidem respuat nec apostolice predicacionis
fundamenta possideat, ne quam labem perfidie possit
aspergere deserenda est." Quod Apostolus quoque
evidenter asseruit dicens, "Hominem hereticum post
unam et aliam correpcionem devita." Ex quibus verbis
evidenter apparet quod aliqua ecclesia potest heretica
infici pravitate, et illam dicunt esse ecclesiam
clericorum, que tunc non esset vera ecclesia sed foret
ecclesia malignancium nuncupanda. Cum vero dixisti
notum esse quod soli clerici vocantur ecclesia et
ecclesiastici viri, dicunt quod contrarium per Scripturam
Divinam et eciam per decreta sanctorum patrum est
notum, sicut ostensum est.

Through this they reply to the first argument, saying
that one church can err against faith while another
can not do so. The clergy are that church which can
err, however, but not that church which can not err
against faith, although if they are catholic they are
part of that church which can not err. They try to
prove by a text of blessed Ambrose that there is
indeed a church that can become heretical. For as is
found in 24, q. 1, c. Que dignior, Ambrose says
[col.976], "If there is some church that rejects faith
and does not possess the bases of apostolic
preaching, it should be abandoned so that it can not
scatter its stain of perfidy. The Apostle also clearly
affirmed this when he said [Titus 3:10], "A man that
is a heretic, after the first and second admonition,
avoid." It is clearly apparent from these words that
some church can be infected with heretical
wickedness. And they say that that church is the
church of the clergy, which would then not be the
true church but should be called the church of the
wicked. But when you said that it is known that only
the clergy are called the church and ecclesiastical
personages, they say that, as has been shown, the
opposite is known through divine scripture and also
through the ordinances of the holy fathers.

Discipulus Ista racio non erat ita fortis sicut videbatur,
