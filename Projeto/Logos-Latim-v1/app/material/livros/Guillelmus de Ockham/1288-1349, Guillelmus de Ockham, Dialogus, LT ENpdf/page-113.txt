Magister
Obiectiones
illae
fundantur
in
aequivocatione de fide implicita. Est enim una fides
implicita vera omnem assertionem pertinacem
respectu
cuiuscumque
haereticae
pravitatis
excludens. Et ista fides implicita sufficit ad hoc quod
habens eam sit catholicus et fidelis. Alia est fides
implicita falsa, qua scilicet creditur hanc esse veram,
"fides Christiana est vera", sed alia fides quam illa
quae est vere Christiana pro Christiana habetur. Et
talem fidem habuerunt Manichei quia credebant
fidem Christianam esse veram, sed illam fidem
vocaverunt Christianam quae in rei veritate non est
Christiana, immo est contraria fidei Christianae. Et
sic est de omnibus haereticis nescienter quod licet
credant hanc esse veram, "fides Christiana vel fides
ecclesiae universalis est vera", tamen fidem reputant
Christianam quae in rei veritate non est Christiana
licet credant eam esse Christianam. Et ideo quamvis
nescienter haeretici sunt.

Master Those objections are based on the ambiguity of
"implicit faith". For there is a true implicit faith which
excludes every pertinacious assertion of any heretical
wickedness at all. And that implicit faith is sufficient for
the one having it to be catholic and faithful. There is
another false implicit faith, by which, that is, it is
believed to be true that "the christian faith is true", but
another faith than that which is truly christian is held to
be christian. The manichees had such faith because they
believed that the christian faith is true; but they called
christian that faith which in point of fact is not christian;
indeed it is opposed to the christian faith. And so it is
with all who are unknowingly heretics, that although
they believe that it is true that the christian faith or the
faith of the universal church is true, yet they regard as
christian a faith which in point of fact is not christian,
although they believe that it is christian. And they are
therefore heretics, although unknowingly so.

Discipulus Nunquid aliqui credentes fidem
Christianam esse veram habent falsam fidem?

Disciple Do some people who believe that the christian
faith is true have false faith?

Magister Nullus propter hoc quod credit fidem
Christianam esse veram habet falsam fidem, sed
credens quandam fidem esse Christianam quae in rei
veritate non est Christiana habet falsam fidem. Sic
Arrius in hoc quod credidit quod fides Christiana est
vera et quod evangelium continet veritatem non
habuit falsam fidem, sed credendo quod Filius Dei
non est aequalis Patri et quod hoc pertinet ad
catholicam fidem habuit falsam fidem.

Master No one has false faith for the reason that he
believes that the christian faith is true; but in believing
that a particular faith is christian which in point of fact is
not christian he has false faith. Thus Arius did not have
false faith because of the fact that he believed that the
christian faith is true and that the Gospel contains the
truth, but he had false faith in believing that the Son of
God is not equal to the Father and that this pertains to
catholic faith.

Discipulus Adhuc non sunt illa argumenta soluta
quia fundantur in hac propositione, "omnis fides
implicita vera sufficit ad hoc quod habens eam sit
catholicus et fidelis".

Disciple Those arguments are still not refuted because
they are based on the proposition that every true implicit
faith is sufficient for the one having it to be catholic and
faithful.

Magister De fide distinguitur, quia quaedam ponitur
fides infusa quam etiam parvuli baptizati habere
dicuntur, et de hac posset concedi propositio quam
assumis; secundum illam nullus esset haereticus
nescienter. Alia est fides acquisita, quae est
credulitas quaedam qua quis absque dubitatione
alicui assertioni adhaeret. Et sic est propositio falsa,
quia non omnis talis fides implicita vera sufficit ad
hoc quod habens eam sit catholicus et fidelis.
Quamvis enim nullus sit infidelis propter
quamcunque fidem veram, tamen poterit habens
unam fidem veram esse infidelis propter aliam fidem
falsam.

Master: A distinction is made about faith, because there
is a certain infused faith which even baptised children
are said to have; and about this [faith] the proposition
which you assume could be granted; according to this no
one would be unknowingly a heretic. Another faith is
that which is acquired and this is a credence by which
anyone adheres without doubting to some assertion. And
in this sense the proposition is false because not every
such implicit and true faith is sufficient for the one
having it to be catholic and faithful. For although no one
is unfaithful because of any true faith, yet someone
having a true faith could be unfaithful because of some
other false faith.

Discipulus Tantummodo quantum ad istam
materiam indica quid dicitur ad illam propositionem:
qui credit totam fidem Christianam esse veram habet
fidem de omni veritate pertinente ad fidem
Christianam.

Disciple Point out, with respect to that subject only,
what is said to the proposition that he who believes that
the whole christian faith is true has faith in every truth
which pertains to christian faith.
