mortuum; quod corpus quod iacuit in sepulchro Christi
triduo nunquam fuit corpus Christi dum viveret; quod
corpora et reliquiae quae a fidelibus pro corporibus
sanctorum et reliquiis venerantur nunquam fuerunt
corpora nec partes sanctorum dum viverent; quod
corpora mortua nunquam fuerunt corpora viventium;
quod caro mortua nunquam fuit viva.

alive and dead; that the body that lay in Christ's tomb
over the three days was never Christ's body when he
was alive; that the bodies and relics that are venerated
by believers as the bodies and relics of saints were
never the bodies and parts of the saints when they
were alive; that dead bodies were never the bodies of
people alive; that dead flesh was never living.

Discipulus Satis exemplificasti de conclusionibus
sequentibus ex opinione de unitate formae
substantialis, et ideo ad propositum redeundo explica
rationes, si quae sunt, pro assertione praedicta.

Student You have sufficiently exemplified the
conclusions which follow from that opinion about the
unity of substantial form, and so returning to our plan
set out the arguments for the above assertion, if there
are any.

Magister Assertionem suam probant isti tali ratione.
Omne illud quod potest licite praetermitti a subditis
potest ex causa rationabili a praelatis et iurisdictionem
habentibus super subditos interdici; nam qui praeest
potest et debet in omnibus utilitati omnium providere
et periculis obviare, et in talibus licitis et honestis
oportet subditos obedire, ut colligitur ex sacris
canonibus 11, q. 3, c. Si autem et c. Si quis et c. Absit;
sed opiniones aliquas non defendere nec docere est
licitum, imo quandoque necessarium et expediens, ergo
et potest a praelatis et collegiis iurisdictionem
habentibus ex causa rationabili interdici.

Master They prove their assertion by the following
argument. Everything that can licitly be omitted by
subjects can for a reasonable cause be forbidden by
prelates and by those having jurisdiction over the
subjects; for he who is in command can and should
make provision for everyone's benefit in all matters
and prevent dangers, and it behoves their subjects to
obey them in permitted and honest matters of this
kind, as we gather from the sacred canons, 11, q. 3, c.
Si autem [col.646], c. Si quis [col.646] and c. Absit
[col.647]; but there are some opinions which it is
permissible, indeed sometimes it is necessary and
expedient, not to defend or teach, and therefore this
can also be forbidden for a reasonable cause by
prelates and colleges having jurisdiction.

Discipulus Secundum hanc rationem liceret quandoque
praelatis interdicere veritates. Nam quandoque tacere
veritatem est expediens.

Student According to this argument prelates would
sometimes be permitted to forbid truths, for it is
sometimes expedient to be silent about the truth.

Magister Interdicere veritatem omnibus et pro omni
tempore nemini licet secundum istos, aliquibus tamen
et pro aliquo tempore imperare ne aliquas veritates
docere praesumant licet, sicut dixit Apostolus, "Mulieri
docere non permitto", et Dominus in evangelio ait,
"Nolite dare sanctum canibus; neque mittatis
margaritas ante porcos." Ex quibus colligitur quod nec
omnibus nec omni tempore veritatem expedit
praedicare aut docere vel defensare.

Master According to them no one is permitted to
forbid the truth to everyone and for all time, yet it is
permissible to order some people for some time not to
presume to teach some truths, just as the Apostle said
[1 Tim. 2:12], "I suffer not a woman to teach", and in
the gospel [Matt. 7:6] the Lord said, "Give not that
which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine." We gather from these words that it is
not expedient for everyone all the time to preach,
teach or defend the truth.

Discipulus Ex hoc videtur quod nulli licet opiniones
seu assertiones quas damnare nequit omnibus et pro
omni tempore interdicere, licet aliquibus et pro aliquo
tempore ipsas licite interdicere possit.

Student It seems from this that no one is permitted to
forbid to everyone for all time opinions or assertions
which he can not condemn, although he can licitly
forbid them to some people for some time.

Magister Hanc conclusionem ipsi concedunt, et ideo
signanter dicunt quod ex causa rationabili licet
inferioribus aliquas assertiones interdicere, per hoc
insinuantes quod cessante causa cesset interdictum.

Master They grant this conclusion, and therefore it is
significant that they say that inferiors are permitted to
forbid some assertions "for a reasonable cause",
implying by this that when the cause ceases the
forbidding ceases.
