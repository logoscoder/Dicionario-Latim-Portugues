CHAPTER 20

Student We have sought to learn what
power the emperor has over those who are
bad; let us now investigate what power he
possesses over the good who are subject to
him. I especially want to ask, however,
whether the emperor has such power over
the good subject to him that all of them are
bound to obey him in everything.

THE EMPEROR'S POWER OVER THE GOOD: ARE THEY BOUND TO OBEY HIM IN EVERYTHING?

Magister Respondetur quod in illicitis et
iniustis nullus debet sibi {*trs. &NaRe}
obedire.

Master The reply is that no one should
obey him in unlawful and unjust matters.

Discipulus Nunquid in omnibus licitis omnes
sibi debent {*debeant &MzNaPeRe} obedire
ita ut peccent {*peccet &MzNaPeRe} qui sibi
recusaverint {*recusaverit &MzNaPeRe} in
licito quocunque {*trs. &MzNaPeRe} {sibi
add. &Pe} obedire?

Student Should all so obey him in
everything lawful that whoever refuses to
obey him in anything lawful commits a sin?

Magister Respondetur quod non ex hoc ipso
{ipse &Mz} quod aliquis in aliquo licito {licite
&Mz} sibi {*trs.4123 &MzNaPeRe} non
obedierit est iudicandus peccare. Si enim alicui
praecipiat {*praeciperet &MzNaPeRe} {*trs.
&MzNaPeRe} ieiunare vel non bibere vinum
vel aliquid tale quod ad officium imperatoris
non pertinet {*spectat &MzNaPeRe}, sibi
obedire minime tenetur {*teneretur
&MzNaPeRe}, sed in his quae spectant ad
regimen populi temporalis et hoc {*temporalis

Master The reply is that it is not the case
from this that anyone who [[reading qui to
govern obedierit]] does not obey him in
something lawful should be judged to be
sinning. For if he were to order someone to
fast or not to drink wine or some such thing
that does not pertain to the office of
emperor, he would not be bound to obey
him, but in those things which pertain to
the government of people in temporal
affairs, everyone is bound to obey him.
