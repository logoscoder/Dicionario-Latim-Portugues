Maior est manifesta. Minor probatur quantum
ad utramque partem. Quod enim Christus fuerit
inferior imperatore et aliis iudicibus
secularibus quantum ad iurisditionem
coactivam probatur, quia qui potest accusari et
contra quem possunt alii testificari iudicari
{preiudicari &Mz} potest {*trs. &NaRe}. Sed
Christus poterat {malo intellectus add. &Re}
accusari, quod ipsemet testatur cum Ioh. 8:[46]
dicit, "Quis ex vobis arguet me de peccato?"
Quibus verbis concessit Christus {*trs.
&NaRe} aliis potestatem accusandi ipsum.
Quod etiam testatur Innocentius III Extra, De
haereticis, Cum ex iniuncto dicens, "Nec
quisquam suae praesumptionis audacia
{*audaciam &NaReZn} illo defendat exemplo,
quod asina legitur reprehendisse prophetas
{*prophetam &NaReZn}, vel quod dominus
ait, `Quis ex vobis arguet me de peccato'" et
infra: "Rursus aliud est quod praelatus sponte
de sua confisus innocentia subditorum se
accusationibus supponit, in quo casu
praemissum Domini verbum debet intelligi."
Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod Christus
poterat accusari. Ergo et poterat iudicari ab illo
coram quo poterat accusari.

The major [premise] is manifest; both parts of
the minor [premise] are proved. For it is
proved that as far as coercive jurisdiction was
concerned Christ was inferior to the emperor
and other secular judges, because he who can
be accused and against whom others can
testify can be judged. But Christ was able to
be accused, as he himself testifies when he
says in John 8:46, "Which of you convicts me
of sin?" By these words Christ granted to
others the power to accuse him. Innocent III
also attests to this, saying in Extra, De
haereticis, c. Cum ex iniuncto [c.12, col.784],
"And let no one defend the rashness of his
presumption by that example in which we
read that an ass reproved the prophet or that
in which the Lord said, `Which of you
convicts me of sin?' ... Another again is that a
prelate relying willingly on his innocence
submits himself to the accusations of his
subjects; the above words of the Lord should
be understood as such a case." We understand
from these words that Christ was able to be
accused. Therefore he was also able to be
judged by that one before whom he could be
accused.

Discipulus Istud non concludit {includit
&Mz} intentum, imo contrarium ex ipso
colligitur quod {*quia &NaRe} Christus
solummodo sponte, sicut innuunt praemissa
verba, se supposuit accusationibus subditorum.
Et ita Christus non potuit iudicari nisi quia
voluit. Et per consequens iudices non erant
superiores Christo. Ex quo infertur quod
exemplo Christi non potest concludi de papa
quod teneatur subire iudicium imperatoris. Sed
quod papa sponte potest se subiicere
{*submittere &NaRe} {*trs. &NaRe}
accusationibus aliorum, ut plures sacri canones
{*trs. &NaRe} testantur.

Student That is not conclusive for its
purpose; indeed from it we gather the
opposite, because, as the above words imply
it was only of his own free will that Christ
submitted himself to the accusations of his
subjects. And so Christ could be judged only
if he wanted to be. And consequently the
judges were not superior to Christ. From this
we infer that from the example of Christ it
can not be concluded of the pope that he is
bound to submit to the judgement of the
emperor, but that the pope can submit of his
own free will to the accusations of others, as
many sacred canons attest.

Magister Videtur aliis quod verba praemissa
probant intentum, scilicet quod Christus
poterat accusari, ita quod iudices, qui
accusatores audire debebant, non poterant
repellere volentes accusare Christum nisi ex

Master It seems to others that the above
words do establish their purpose, namely that
Christ was able to be accused, in this way,
that the judges, who were bound to listen to
the accusers, could not reject those wanting
