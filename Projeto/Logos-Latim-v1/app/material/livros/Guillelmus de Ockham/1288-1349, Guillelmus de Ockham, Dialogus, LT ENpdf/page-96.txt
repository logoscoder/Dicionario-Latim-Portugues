and, consequently, a heretic.
Discipulus Ista sola particula quarta reddit errantem
pertinacem et haereticum. Aliae ergo praecedentes
videntur esse superfluae.

Student That fourth clause alone renders an errant
pertinacious and heretical. Therefore the other
preceding ones seem superfluous.

Magister Licet secundum istos ista ultima particula
reddat errantem pertinacem et non aliae, tamen ex aliis
habetur violenta praesumptio quod errans pertinaciter
suo adhaeret errori, quia ex eis habetur praesumptio,
cuius contrarium probari non potest, quod talis errans
non est paratus corrigi et per consequens inter
pertinaces et haereticos est habendus.

Master Although according to them that last clause,
and not the others, renders an errant pertinacious, yet
from those others we have a violent presumption that
an errant is adhering pertinaciously to his error,
because from them we have a presumption, the
opposite of which can not be proved, that such an
errant is not ready to be corrected and, consequently,
should be held to be among the pertinacious and the
heretical.

Capitulum 7

Chapter 7

Discipulus Ad probandum nullum errantem contra
fidem esse haereticum nisi pertinaciter suo errori
adhaereat verba praemissa beati Augustini satis prolixe
tractasti. Nunc ad eandem conclusionem alias
probationes adducas, si quas alias cogitasti?

Student You have discussed copiously enough the
words of blessed Augustine set out above to prove
that no one erring against the faith is a heretic unless
he clings pertinaciously to his error. Would you now
adduce other proofs for the same conclusion, if you
have thought of others?

Magister Haec eadem conclusio auctoritate Augustini
contra Manicheos quae recitatur 24, q. 3, c. Qui in
Ecclesia Christi probatur. Ait enim, "Qui in ecclesia
Christi morbidum aliquid pravumque sapiunt si
correcti, ut sanum rectumque sapiant, resistunt
contumaciter suaque pestifera et mortifera dogmata
emendare nolunt, sed defendere persistunt, haeretici
sunt." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi non omnes qui in
ecclesia Christi morbidum aliquid pravumque quid
sapiunt esse statim haereticos iudicandos, sed antea
sunt de pertinacia convincendi secundum quod in
verbis praescriptis innuit Augustinus.

Master This same conclusion is proved by a text of
Augustine against the Manichees which is recorded in
24, q. 3, c. Qui in ecclesia Christi [col.998]. For he
says, "Those in the church of Christ who think
something unwholesome and perverse and
contumaciously resist if they are corrected that they
might think something wholesome and sound and
refuse to correct their pestiferous and deadly teachings
but persist in defending them are heretics." We are
given to understand by these words that not all those
in the church of Christ who are inspired by something
unwholesome and perverse should immediately be
judged heretical, but, according to what Augustine
implies in the above words, they should be convicted
of pertinacity first.

Discipulus In verbis praedictis Augustinus insinuare
videtur quod non omnes errantes in ecclesia Christi
pertinaciter pro haereticis sunt habendi, cum videatur
innuere quod tria requiruntur ad hoc ut illi qui in
ecclesia Christi morbidum aliquid pravumque quid
sapiunt sint haeretici. Primum est quod correcti ut
rectum sanumque sapiant resistant contumaciter.
Secundum est quod suos errores emendare nolint.
Tertium est quod eosdem errores persistant defendere.
Si autem ista tria requiruntur ad hoc quod aliquis sit
haereticus, ut Augustinus insinuare videtur, et multi
suis erroribus adhaerent pertinaciter qui tamen eos non
defendunt, immo quandoque negant, sequitur quod non
omnes suis erroribus pertinaciter adhaerentes
haereticorum numero aggregantur.

[See Significant Variants, para. 12.] Student
Augustine seems to imply in the above words that not
all those in the church of Christ who err pertinaciously
should be held to be heretics, since he seems to imply
that three things are required for those in the church of
Christ who are inspired by something unwholesome
and perverse to be heretics. The first is that they resist
contumaciously when corrected that they might be
inspired by what is wholesome and sound. The second
is that they refuse to correct their errors. The third is
that they persist in defending those same errors. If
those three are required, however, for someone to be a
heretic, as Augustine seems to imply, and many
people cling to their errors pertinaciously who
nevertheless do not defend them - indeed sometimes
