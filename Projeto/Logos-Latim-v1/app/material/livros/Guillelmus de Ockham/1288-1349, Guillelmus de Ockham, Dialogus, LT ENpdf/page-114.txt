Magister Hoc negatur de fide quae reddit aliquem
catholicum, nisi, credens totam fidem Christianam
esse veram, nullam fidem reputet Christianam nisi
illam solam quae vere est Christiana.

Master This is denied about the faith that makes
someone catholic, unless, while believing that the whole
christian faith is true, he considers no faith to be
christian except that alone which truly is christian.

Capitulum 5

Chapter 5.

Discipulus Postquam tecum collationem habui de
pertinacia interiori volo aliqua interrogare de
pertinacia exteriori, quando scilicet propter ea quae
apparent exterius debent catholici aliquem errantem
contra fidem tanquam pertinacem habere, et
quomodo de pertinacia in iudicio debeat quis
convinci. In primis autem cupio scire an uno modo
tantum vel pluribus possit constare aliquem errantem
contra fidem esse pertinacem.

Disciple Now that I have had a discussion with you
about interior pertinacity, I want to ask some things
about exterior pertinacity. When, for example, because
of some outward appearance should catholics hold
someone erring against the faith to be pertinacious, and
how should anyone be convicted in court of pertinacity?
First of all, however, I want to know whether it can be
established in one way only or in several ways that
someone erring against the faith is pertinacious.

Magister Plures modi ponuntur quibus possunt
catholici praesumptionem accipere violentam de
aliquo quod est pertinax in errore.

Master Several ways are described by which catholics
can accept the violent presumption of someone that he is
pertinacious in error.

Discipulus Primo tractemus unum modum, postea
alium.

Disciple Let us first deal with one way; later with
another.

Twenty ways of extablishing from external behaviour a presumption that a person is a heretic
Magister Primus modus quo potest quis de
pertinacia deprehendi est si facto vel verbo monstrat
se non firmiter credere fidem Christianam esse
veram et sanam, puta si dicit fidem Christianam esse
falsam vel dubiam, vel ad sectam aliam se convertit,
utpote si facit se circumcidi vel Mahometum adorat.
De tali enim licet cuilibet iudicare quod pertinaciter
errat vel dubitat contra veritatem et quod est scienter
haereticus manifestus. Et si convictus fuerit vel
confessus in iudicio quod tale quid dixerit vel fecerit
sine ulteriori examinatione est tanquam pertinax et
haereticus condemnandus.

Master The first way by which someone can be
detected being pertinacious is if he shows by deed or by
word that he does not firmly believe that the christian
faith is true and sound; for instance, if he says that the
christian faith is false or doubtful or if he converts to
some other sect, namely has himself circumcised or
worships Mahommed. Anyone is allowed to pronounce
of such a person that he pertinaciously errs or doubts
against the faith and that he is knowingly a manifest
heretic. And if he has been convicted or has confessed in
court that he said or did such a thing he is to be
condemned as pertinacious and a heretic without further
questioning.

Discipulus Potestne inveniri casus in quo talis possit
de pravitate haeretica excusari?

Disciple Can a situation be found in which such a
person can be excused of heretical wickedness?

Magister Unus solus casus quantum ad fidei
abnegationem excipitur, scilicet si metu mortis fidem
negaverit dicendo fidem Christianam esse falsam vel
dubiam. Duo vero excipiuntur quantum ad factum
haereticale. Primus est si quis metu mortis actum
haereticalem commiserit, puta si pro morte vitanda
quis adoraverit Mahometum. Et isto modo excusatur
beatus Marcellinus, quod immolando idolis non fuit
effectus haereticus, licet mortale peccatum
commiserit. Secundus casus est si absoluta coactione
quis coactus fuerit actum haereticalem committere,
in quo casu etiam ab omni peccato excusatur.

Master Only one situation of denying the faith is
excepted and that is if someone in fear of death has
denied the faith by saying that the christian faith is false
or doubtful. There are, however, two exceptions with
respect to an heretical act. The first is if someone has
committed an heretical act out of fear of death, if, for
example, someone has adored Mohammed in order to
avoid death. It is in this way that blessed Marcellin is
excused, because he did not become a heretic by
sacrificing to idols, even though he committed a mortal
sin. The second exception is if someone is forced by
unrestricted force to commit an heretical act; in this
situation he is excused too of all sin.
