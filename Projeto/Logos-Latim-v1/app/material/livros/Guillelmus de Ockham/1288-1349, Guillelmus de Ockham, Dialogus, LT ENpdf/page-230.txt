nequaquam asseritur quod civitas Romana ad dominium
veniet paganorum, ita temerarie divinando de futuris
nobis incognitis affirmatur quod numquam infideles
sunt civitatem occupaturi Romanam et cunctos de
eadem civitate expulsuri fideles, et ita temerarium est
dicere quod numquam de Roma omnes catholici
expellentur. Et sicut temerarium est dicere quod
numquam omnes Christiani expellentur de civitate
Romana nequaquam amplius reversuri, ita temerarium
est dicere quod si per potenciam infidelium omnes
Christiani Romani preter decem vel duodecim essent
expulsi de Roma numquam in perpetuum reversuri quod
illi decem vel duodecem remanentes non possent contra
fidem errare nec ad sectam occupancium Romam
converti.

is not clear that the city of Rome can not be made
subject to unbelievers, just as in ancient times the city
of Rome made other provinces subject to it. Just as it
is not asserted without rashness, therefore, that the
city of Rome will come under the dominion of
pagans, so it is rash to affirm by prophesying
concerning future events that are unknown to us that
unbelievers will never occupy the city of Rome and
expel all the believers from the city; and so it is rash
to say that all the catholics will never be driven out of
Rome. [See Significant Variants, para. 36.]And just
as it is rash to say that all the Christians will never be
driven out of the city of Rome not to return again, so
it is rash to say that if by the power of unbelievers all
the Roman Christians except for ten or twelve were
driven out of Rome never again to return, those ten or
twelve who remain could not err against faith or be
converted to the sect of those occupying Rome.

Discipulus Si omnes modo Christiani de civitate
Romana per potenciam infidelium expellerentur non
propter hoc ecclesia Romana desineret, sicut nec
expulsi desinerent esse Romani.

Student: If all Christians were driven out of the city
of Rome now by the power of unbelievers, the
Roman church would not on that account cease, just
as those who were driven out would not fail to be
Romans.

Magister Concedunt quod propter hoc non desineret
Romana ecclesia; expulsis tamen mortuis sine prole,
quod non esset impossibile, et desineret Romana
ecclesia et amplius non essent Romani aliqui Christiani.

Master: They grant that the Roman church would not
cease on that account, but if those who were driven
out died without issue, which would not be
impossible, the Roman church would cease and there
would no longer be any Roman Christians.

Discipulus Mortuis omnibus illis sine prole adhuc
possent aliqui ordinari clerici loco priorum, et illud
collegium clericorum posset vocari Romana ecclesia.

Student: If they did all die without issue some clerics
could still be ordained in place of the earlier ones,
and that college of clerics could be called the Roman
church.

Magister Hoc impugnatur dupliciter: primo, quia per
talem modum posset dici quod ecclesia Pisana non
posset contra fidem errare, quia sive omnes Pisani
expellerentur de Pisis sive omnes fierent heretici sive
universi morerentur, possent clerici ordinari et vocaliter
tituli priorum Pisanorum deputari eisdem. Secundo,
quia dicunt nonnulli quod fides ecclesie posset
remanere in puris laicis; ymmo dicunt quidam quod
posset salvari in mulieribus, quemadmodum tempore
passionis Christi salvata fuit in sola matre Christi.

Master: This is attacked in two ways. [It is attacked]
first because by that means it could be said that the
Pisan church could not err against faith because
whether all the Pisans were driven out of Pisa or all
were to become heretics or all were to die, clerics
could be ordained and the former Pisan titular
churches could be allotted to them explicitly. [It is
attacked] secondly because some people say that the
faith of the church could remain in mere laypeople;
indeed some say that it could be preserved in women,
as at the time of Christ's passion it was preserved
only in Christ's mother.

Discipulus Dic aliam racionem istorum, si quam
habent, pro assercione sua principali.

Student: Tell me another argument for their main
assertion, if they have one..

Magister Decima racio eorum est hec. Ecclesia militans
non est magis accepta a Deo quam fuerit tota multitudo
angelorum ante confirmacionem bonorum et casum
malorum; sed nulla pars tocius multitudinis angelorum

[See Significant Variants, para. 37.]Master: Their
tenth argument is this. The church militant has not
been accepted by God more than was the whole
multitude of angels before the confirmation of the
