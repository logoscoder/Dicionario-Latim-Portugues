omni approbatione ecclesiae ex natura rei sunt
immutabiles et immutabiliter verae, ita immutabiliter
sunt catholicae reputandae et consimiliter sicut
haereses absque omni damnatione ecclesiae sunt falsae
ita absque omni damnatione ecclesiae sunt haereses.

any approval by the church catholic truths are
immutable and immutably true by the very nature of
things so they should be regarded as immutably
catholic, and similarly just as heresies are false
without any condemnation by the church so they are
heresies without any condemnation by the church.

Discipulus Ista sententia magis me allicit et ideo si
potest rationibus confirmari eas non differas allegare.

Student That opinion attracts me more, and so if it
can be confirmed by arguments do not hesitate to
bring them forward.

Magister Ista sententia rationibus paucis ostenditur
quarum prima est haec. Si aliqua veritas est catholica
aut est dicenda catholica quia a Deo revelata vel quia
in Scripturis Divinis contenta vel quia ab ecclesia
universali recepta vel quia sequitur ex illis aut ex
aliquo illorum quae sunt divinitus revelata et in
Scripturis Divinis inventa et ab ecclesia universali
recepta vel quia a summo pontifice approbata.

Master That opinion is shown by a few arguments of
which the first is this. [A] If any truth is catholic it
should be called catholic [Ai] either because it has
been revealed by God, [Aii] or because it is contained
in the divine scriptures, [Aiii] or because it has been
accepted by the universal church, [Aiv] or because it
follows from those things or some of those things that
have been divinely revealed and found in the divine
scriptures and accepted by the universal church, [Av]
or because it has been approved by the highest pontiff.

Si aliqua veritas ideo est catholica quia est a Deo
revelata et revelatio divina nullatenus dependet ex
approbatione summi pontificis nec ex approbatione
totius ecclesiae, ergo approbatio summi pontificis nihil
facit ad hoc quod talis veritas sit vere catholica.

[Ai] Now if some truth is catholic because it has been
revealed by God and that divine revelation does not
depend on the approval of the highest pontiff nor on
the approval of the whole church, the approval of the
highest pontiff, in that case, adds nothing to the fact
that such a truth is truly catholic.

Si detur secundum, scilicet quod aliqua veritas est
catholica quia in Divinis Scripturis inserta, et constat
quod talem veritatem inseri in Scripturis Divinis ex
nulla approbatione ecclesiae vel papae dependet, ergo
talis veritas absque omni approbatione tali inter
veritates catholicas est numeranda.

[Aii] If the second is granted, namely that some truth
is catholic because it is inserted in the divine
scriptures, and it is certain that the insertion of such a
truth in the divine scriptures does not depend on any
approval by the church or pope, that truth should
therefore be numbered among catholic truths without
any such approval.

Si detur tertium, scilicet quod aliqua veritas est
catholica quia ab ecclesia universali recepta,
quaerendum est quare ecclesia universalis talem recipit
veritatem: aut quia sibi divinitus revelatur vel etiam
inspiratur, et tunc absque tali receptione ecclesiae vere
est catholica quia divinitus revelatur vel etiam
inspiratur; aut eam recipit universalis ecclesia quia eam
in Divinis Scripturis invenit, et tunc adhuc absque tali
receptione est catholica iudicanda; aut recipit eam
universalis ecclesia quia per experientiam vel rationem
naturalem eam cognoscit, quod de multis veritatibus
catholicis nullatenus dici potest, et tunc etiam ecclesia
in faciendo aliquam veritatem catholicam rationi vel
experientiae inniteretur, quod dici non potest.
Sequeretur enim quod ecclesia universalis omnem
veritatem geometricam et omnes alias quarumcunque
scientiarum demonstrative probatas posset veritatibus
catholicis aggregare; ex quo sequeretur quod omnes
assertiones falsas huiusmodi veritatibus naturaliter
notis contrarias posset ecclesia universalis inter

[Aiii] If the third is granted, namely that some truth is
catholic because it has been accepted by the universal
church, it should be asked why the universal church
receives such a truth: [Aiiia] either because it is
divinely revealed to it or also inspired in it, and then it
is truly catholic without such acceptance by the
church because it is divinely revealed or even
inspired; [Aiiib] or the universal church accepts it
because it finds it in the divine scriptures, and then
again it should be judged as catholic without any such
acceptance; [Aiiic] or the universal church accepts it
because it knows it by experience or natural reason which can not be said about many catholic truths - and
then also in making some truth catholic the church
would be relying on reason or experience, and this can
not be said. For it would follow that the universal
church could add every geometrical truth and
everything else proved demonstratively by any
science at all to catholic truths; from this it would
follow that the universal church could count as among
