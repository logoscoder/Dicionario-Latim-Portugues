veritati obviat orthodoxae. Dicunt etiam quod si omnes
in generali concilio congregati praeter ipsum assererent
talem assertionem esse haereticam, nisi suam
sententiam
miraculo
confirmarent
vel
per
informationes suas facerent ipsum advertere quomodo

repugnat catholicae.

other way, that the assertion conflicts with orthodox
truth. They also say that if everyone gathered together
in a general council except him were to assert that
such an assertion is heretical he should not solemnly
condemn it, however much they all insist, unless they
confirm their opinion with a miracle or by their
instruction they bring him to understand how it
conflicts with catholic truth, but he would be bound to
wait until it became clearly known to him either by
divine revelation, by the working of a miracle directed
to the disproving of that heresy, by his own
meditation, by someone else's instruction or by some
other means that such an assertion is opposed to
catholic truth.

Discipulus Miror quomodo isti dogmatizare
praesumunt quod unus homo mortalis quacunque
praeditus dignitate magis debet adhaerere propriae
fantasiae quam omnibus viris literatis et sanctis ad
generale concilium convocatis.

Student I wonder how they presume to teach as
doctrine that one mortal man, endowed with whatever
dignity, ought to cling to his own fantasy rather than
to all the holy and learned men called together for a
general council.

Magister Sententiam praedictam non capis, ut video.
Non enim dicunt quod debet papa fantasiae propriae
adhaerere, sed dicunt quod non debet propter verba
hominum aliquam assertionem contra conscientiam vel
praeter conscientiam propriam condemnare.

Master You do not understand that opinion, it seems
to me. For they do not say that a pope ought to cling
to his own fantasy, but they say that because of the
words of men he should not condemn any assertion
against or beyond his own conscience.

Discipulus Videtur quod papa in hoc casu tenetur
conscientiam suam secundum conscientiam tot et
tantorum virorum formare.

Student It seems that in this case a pope is bound to
fashion his own conscience according to the
conscience of so many great men.

Magister Dicunt quod in his quae fidei sunt non debet
papa inniti conscientiis hominum sed soli auctoritati
divinae.

Master They say that in those matters that concern
the faith the pope should not rely on the consciences
of men but only on divine authority.

Discipulus Incipio magis advertere sententiam
memoratam. Unde ipsam auctoritatibus vel rationibus
munire coneris?

Student I am beginning to give more attention to that
opinion. Would you therefore try to support it with
authorities or arguments?

Magister Pro ista sententia plures rationes
auctoritatibus communitae possunt adduci, quarum
prima est haec. Omnes praeter papam in generali
concilio congregati non sunt maioris auctoritatis quam
Christus nec omnibus illis magis est credendum quam
Christo; sed si Christus venisset et veritatem
catholicam inauditam praedicasset et ad confirmandum
suam doctrinam nullum fecisset miraculum, Iudaei,
licet suae praedicationi minime credidissent, peccatum
nullatenus habuissent; ergo multo fortius potest papa
absque peccato sententiae omnium aliorum in generali
concilio existentium, si per eos nullum fit miraculum
ad suam sententiam confirmandam, nec ipsi faciunt
eum intelligere quomodo sua sententia in veritate
catholica est fundata, minime adhaerere, et per

Master Many arguments fortified by authorities can
be brought forward in support of that opinion. The
first of them is this. All the people except the pope
who are gathered together in a general council are not
of greater authority than Christ nor should all of them
be believed more than Christ; but if Christ had come
and preached an unheard of catholic truth and had not
performed any miracle to confirm his teaching, the
Jews would not have had sin even if they had not
believed his preaching; much more is it the case,
therefore, that without sin the pope is able not to
adhere to an opinion of everyone else in a general
council if no miracle is done by them to confirm their
opinion and if they do not make him understand how
their opinion is based on catholic truth; and
