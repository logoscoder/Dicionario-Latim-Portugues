papa qui sponte renunciasset papatui potest errare
contra fidem; ergo papa eciam ante deposicionem et
renunciacionem spontaneam potest errare contra fidem.
Antecedens patet quia si papa depositus et qui
renunciavit papatui non posset errare contra fidem
sequeretur quod aliquis purus viator multis involutus
peccatis alius a papa non posset contra fidem errare.
Consequencia probatur: quia per actum meritorium non
acquiritur viatori potestas errandi contra fidem; sed tam
deposicio pape quam renunciacio spontanea potest esse
meritoria. Si enim papa dignus deponi suam
deposicionem acceptat vel propter Deum sustinet
pacienter in hoc meretur. Unde si Iohannes 12 quando
deponebatur de papatu ex amore Dei pacienter
tollerasset apud Deum meritum habuisset. Probabile est
eciam quod tam Symachus papa, qui renuncians
papatui adhesit undecim milibus virginum, quam
Celestinus V renunciando papatui merebatur coram
Deo. Non ergo per deposicionem nec per
renunciacionem huiusmodi acquiritur potestas errandi
contra fidem, et ita papa ante deposicionem et
renunciacionem habet potestatem errandi contra fidem
sicut et post.

and a pope who had renounced the papacy of his own
free will can err against the faith; therefore a pope can
also err against the faith before his deposition and
voluntary renunciation. The antecedent is clear
because if a deposed pope and one who has renounced
the papacy could not err against the faith it would
follow that some mere pilgrim entangled in many sins,
besides the pope, would not be able to err against the
faith. The consequence is proved because a pilgrim
does not acquire the power of erring against the faith
by a meritorious act; but both the deposition of a pope
and [a pope's] voluntary renunciation can be
meritorious. For if a pope who deserves to be deposed
accepts his deposition or patiently endures it for God's
sake he acquires merit. So if from love of God John
XII had endured it patiently when he was deposed
from the papacy he would have acquired merit with
God. It is probable too that both Pope Symachus, who
renounced the papacy and adhered to 11000 virgins ,
and Celestine V, who renounced the papacy, acquired
merit before God. So the power of erring against the
faith is not acquired by such a deposition or
renunciation and so a pope has the power to err
against the faith before his deposition or renunciation
just as he does after it.

Discipulus Ista racio videtur unam assercionem falsam
accipere, quod papa scilicet ante deposicionem possit
contra fidem errare. Nam videtur secundum iura quod
quam cito papa erraret contra fidem tam cito esset
depositus.

Student: That argument seems to accept one false
assertion, namely that a pope can err against the faith
before he is deposed. For according to law it seems
that as soon as a pope were to err against the faith he
would be deposed.

Magister Ad istam instanciam nonnulli respondent
dicentes quod est deposicio duplex, scilicet ab homine
et a iure. Ante deposicionem ab homine potest papa
errare contra fidem et hereticam incurrere pravitatem,
et de ista deposicione procedit racio supradicta quia
primo papa factus hereticus et postea, conversus et
satisfaciens Deo, posset deponi ab homine quam
deposicionem posset meritorie acceptare. Ante
deposicionem autem a iure potest papa ex simplicitate
vel ignorancia contra fidem errare sed non numero
hereticorum aggregari, quia, licet a fide ex ignorancia
vel simplicitate deviaverit, si tamen paratus est corrigi
non est papatu privatus, sed si pertinaciter errori contra
fidem adheserit est ipso facto depositus de papatu et de
iure omni auctoritate nudatus non ab homine sed a iure.

Master: Some people reply to this objection by
saying that there are two senses of 'deposition',
namely by man and by law. A pope can err against the
faith and incur heretical wickedness before being
deposed by man and the above argument is effective
about that deposition because the pope first becomes a
heretic and later, having changed and become
satisfactory to God, he could be deposed by man and
could accept that deposition meritoriously. Before
deposition by law, however, a pope can err against the
faith out of simplicity or ignorance but not be added
to the number of heretics because even if he has
deviated from the faith out of ignorance or simplicity
yet if he is prepared to be corrected he is not deprived
of the papacy; but if he clings pertinaciously to his
error against the faith he is by that very fact deposed
from the papacy and as a matter of law stripped of all
authority, not by man but by law.

Discipulus Adde alias raciones.

Student: Add other arguments.

Magister Septima racio eorum est hec: nullus per
dignitatem acceptam indigne, illegitime et inique
confirmatur in fide; sed contingit aliquem indignum ad
papatum ascendere illicite et inique, quia per

Master: Their seventh argument is this. No one is
confirmed in faith by a dignity which is received
unworthily, illegitimately and wrongly; but it is
possible for someone unworthy to ascend illicitly and
