Hostiensis quae talis est, "Ego Titius iuro ad

your life or limbs or that honour which
you have. And in the city of Rome I will
not, without your advice, make any
decree or agreement [[technical words?]]
about anything that pertains to you or to
the Romans. And whatever comes into
our power from the land on St. Peter I
will return to you. And I will make the
one, whoever it is, on whom I bestow the
Italian kingdom swear that he is your
helper in defending the land of St. Peter
in accord with his power." However, the
form by which a vassal swears to his lord
is, according to Hostiensis, as follows, "I
swear by the holy gospels of God that
from this very moment [[a modo in antea
-- antea means the past]] I will be faithful
to this person, as a vassal should be to his
lord, and what he has bestowed on me in
the name of fidelity I will not, to his
detriment, knowingly open for anyone
else." The same Hostiensis describes
another recent form which is as follows:
"I Titius swear on the holy gospels of
God that from this very moment until the
last day of my life I will be faithful
against all men to you, Gaius, my lord." It
is clear to some people from these forms
of swearing that the oath of emperor Otto
was not an oath of fidelity. This is (i)
because there is no mention of fidelity in
that oath and (ii) because even if some
fidelity should be understood by some of
the words of his oath, yet by none of the
words in it is that fidelity understood
which a vassal owes to his lord. For not
every fidelity is the fidelity which a
vassal owes to his lord. For sometimes
someone should maintain fidelity with his
enemy, because faith should be
maintained with an enemy, (23, q. 1, c.
Noli [c.3, col.892]. And yet that fidelity
which a vassal owes his lord should not
be maintained with an enemy.
