{*supremi &NaRe}, scilicet papa et alius, ex
tali ordinatione sequitur {*sequetur &NaRe}
[[margin Na]] faciliter quod unus contra alium
ad impatientiam et iracundiam provocetur
quia, sicut dicit poeta, "Omnis potestas
impatiens consortis est." Cui satis videtur
alludere Augustinus {*qui add. &NaRe}, ut
legitur 23, q. 7, c. Qui {*Quod Zn} a {*autem
&NaReZn} nobis, ait, "Quis enim avarus
quaerit compossessorem? Quis dominandi
cupiditate inflammatus vel fastu dominationis
elatus desiderat habere consortem?" quasi
diceret, nullis {*nullus &MzNaRe} talis. Ergo
ordinatio communitatis non est bona nec
laudabilis ubi sunt plures iudices summi
{*supremi &NaRe} nullum habentes
superiorem {*trs. &MzNaRe}.

provoked to impatience and anger against the
other, because, as the poet says, "All power is
impatient of a partner." [[Lucan 1, 92-3]] As
we read in 23, q. 7, c. Quod autem nobis [c.3,
col.951], Augustine seems sufficiently to
allude to this when he says, "For what greedy
man seeks a joint-possessor? What man
inflamed with a desire to rule or puffed up
with the arrogance of domination wants to
have a partner?" as though to say, there is no
such person. The regulation of a community,
therefore, is neither good nor praiseworthy
when there are many supreme judges having
no superior.

Ex quibus {*omnibus &NaRe} supradictis
concluditur quod si in communitate fidelium
fuerint plures iudices summi {*supremi
&NaRe} sive plura capita simpliciter prima,
qui vel {*seu &NaRe} quae eosdem pro
eisdem criminibus habeant {habent &Mz}
coercere et eisdem de eisdem praecipere,
sequitur manifeste quod eadem communitas
fidelium semper {super &Mz} erit disposita
{*exposita &Na} discordiis, dissensionibus,
seditionibus, pugnis et guerris tam inter capita
ipsa contraria {*conantia &Na?Re} [[corrected
unclearly from contraria in Re]] {conativa
&Mz} invicem {*se praeferre add. &NaRe}
{se potest ferre add. &Mz} quam inter
subditos {*subiectos &MzNaRe}, quorum
aliqui adhaerebunt uni et alii alteri. Et ideo
pauci erunt vel nulli quin unum odio habebunt
et alterum diligent. Et per consequens unum
sustinebunt et alium {alii &Mz} si poterunt
impugnabunt {*et add. &MzNaRe} ita semper
erit timendum quod non erit pax in
communitate seu congregatione {*fidelium
add. &NaRe}.

We conclude from all of the above that if in a
community of believers there are many
supreme judges or many simply first heads,
who have the power to coerce the same
people for the same crimes and to command
the same things of the same people, it
manifestly follows that that same community
of believers will always be exposed to
discords, dissension, seditions, fighting and
wars both between the heads themselves,
with each trying to put himself ahead of the
other, and among the subjects, some of whom
will adhere to one and some to the other. And
so there will be few people or none that will
not hate one and love the other. And
consequently they will uphold one and, if
they can, attack the other and so it will
always be something to be feared that there
will not be peace in the community or
congregation of believers.
