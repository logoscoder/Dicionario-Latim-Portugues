non pertinaciter, non habet fidem firmam sed infirmam,
teste Bernhardo, qui, libro quinto ad Eugenium papam,
ait: "Fides si habet haesitationem infirma est". Ergo
dubitans de fide non habet veram fidem, et per
consequens non Catholicus sed haereticus est
censendus.

doubts in faith, even if not pertinaciously, does not
have firm faith, but unfirm, as Bernard testifies. In [De
consideratione], addressed to Pope Eugenius, Book 5,
he says: "Faith, if it hesitates, is unfirm". Therefore one
who doubts about the faith does not have true faith, and
consequently should be reckoned not a Catholic but a
heretic.

Istae sunt obiectiones quae mentem meam pulsant
contra descriptionem haeretici memoratam. Quia tamen
praedicta descriptio videtur apparens, dic quomodo ad
praedicta respondent haereticum taliter describentes.

These are the objections that strike my mind against the
above description of a heretic. However, because that
description seems plausible, say how those who thus
describe the heretic answer the above.

Magister Si tibi exponerem quomodo dictam
particulam probare nituntur, eorum responsiones ad
praedicta melius fortassis intelligeres.

Master If I were to expound to you how they try to
prove that element, you would perhaps better
understand their replies to the above.

Discipulus Expone.

Student Expound it.

Proof that pertinacity is required
Magister Quod pertinacia requiratur tam in dubitante
quam in errante ad hoc quod quis sit iudicandus
haereticus multipliciter probare conantur. Primo,
auctoritate Augustini quae ponitur 24, q. 3, c. Dixit
apostolus; qui ait, "Qui sententiam suam, quamvis
falsam atque perversam, nulla pertinaci animositate
defendunt, praesertim quam non audacia suae
praesumptionis pepererunt, sed a seductis atque in
errorem lapsis parentibus acceperunt; quaerunt autem
cauta sollicitudine veritatem corrigi parati cum
invenerint, nequaquam sunt inter haereticos
deputandi". Ex hiis verbis, ut isti dicunt, colligitur
evidenter quod potest quis falsam et perversam tenere
sententiam et inter haereticos minime computari.

Master They try to prove in many ways that
pertinacity is necessary both in someone who doubts
and in someone who errs, if he is to be judged a
heretic. Firstly, on the basis of the text of Augustine
placed in 24, q. 3, c. Dixit apostolus [col.998]; he
says, "Those who without any pertinacious
vehemence defend their opinion, even if it is false and
evil, especially if they have not conceived it with the
boldness of their own presumption but have accepted
it from their parents who have been led astray and
fallen into error and if, moreover, they seek the truth
with careful diligence, ready to be corrected when
they find it, should not be counted among the
heretics." We clearly gather from these words, they
say, that someone can hold a false and evil opinion
and not be counted among the heretics.

Discipulus Clare videtur mihi probatum quod non
omnis dubitans vel errans contra fidem est haereticus
reputandus. Sed non est probatum quod omnis
haereticus pertinaciter dubitat vel errat contra fidem. Et
ideo illam ultimam particulam diffinitionis praedictae
isti per praemissa verba Augustini minime probare
possunt quia omnis particula descriptionis vel
diffinitionis cuiuscunque datae convenienter debet
praedicari de descripto universaliter sumpto. Quod
autem non probent omnem haereticum pertinaciter
dubitare vel errare contra fidem ex verbis beati
Augustini patenter apparet. Nam secundum beatum
Augustinum ad hoc quod aliquis tenens sententiam
falsam atque perversam non debeat reputari haereticus
quatuor requiruntur: primo quod sententiam falsam

Student It seems to me clearly proved that not
everyone who doubts or errs against the faith should
be regarded as a heretic. But it has not been proved
that every heretic doubts or errs against the faith
pertinaciously. And therefore they can not prove the
last element of the aforesaid definition by the above
words of Augustine because every element of any
description or definition suitably given should be
predicated of the thing described taken universally. It
is quite clear, however, that they do not prove from
the words of blessed Augustine that every heretic
doubts or errs against the faith pertinaciously. For
according to blessed Augustine four things are
required if someone holding a false and evil opinion is
not to be regarded as a heretic: firstly, that he not
