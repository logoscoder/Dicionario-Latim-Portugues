&NaRe} aliquem locum in quo sibi subiecti
morantur ut in eodem loco nullus alius sit
iudex summus {*supremus &NaRe}
quorumcunque in illo loco morantium, sicut in
dioecesi Parisiensi est unus solus episcopus et
in provincia Mediolanensi est unus solus

in which those subject to him live, so that in
the same place there is no other supreme
judge of anyone living in that place, just as
there is only one bishop in the diocese of
Paris and only one archbishop in the province
of Milan.

Sequens {*Septima &MzNaRe} allegatio
{*trs. &NaRe} etiam contra istum modum
videtur concludere quod {*quia &NaRe}
potestas non solum est impatiens consortis
super eosdem subiectos sed etiam impatiens
est consortis in eodem loco. Sicut enim iudex
aliquis nollet quod subditi sui essent alterius
subditi {*trs. &MzNaRe}, ita nollet quod
aliquis alius haberet potestatem in loco ubi
subditi sui morantur. Ergo non solum est {*erit
&NaRe} periculosa societas fidelium si sint
plures iudices super eosdem populos vel
subditos {*subiectos &NaRe} sed etiam
periculosa {*erit add. &NaRe} {est add.
&Mz} societas fidelium si in eodem loco etiam
super diversos subditos fideles fuerint plures
summi {*supremi &NaRe} iudices constituti.
Et ita non expedit quod clerici habeant unum
summum {*supremum &NaRe} iudicem
ecclesiasticum, scilicet papam, et laici unum
summum {*supremum &NaRe} iudicem
{*secularem add. &MzNaRe}, scilicet
imperatorem, cum clerici et laici in eisdem
locis simul commaneant.

The seventh argument also seems to be
conclusive against that way [of ruling],
because power is not only impatient of a
partner with respect to the same subjects but
is also impatient of a partner in the same
place. For just as no judge would want his
subjects to be subject to someone else, so he
would not want anyone else to have power in
the place where his subjects live. Not only
will a society of believers be dangerous,
therefore, if there are many judges over the
same people or subjects, such a society will
also be dangerous if many supreme judges
are established in the same place over
different believing subjects. And so it is not
appropriate for clerics to have one supreme
ecclesiastical judge, that is the pope, and
laymen to have one supreme secular judge,
that is the emperor, since clerics and laymen
live together in the same places.

Discipulus Video qualiter praescriptae
allegationes adducuntur contra istum modum
ponendi {*om. &NaRe}. Ideo contra eundem
modum ponendi coneris alias invenire.

Student I see how the earlier arguments are
adduced against that way, so try to find others
against the same way of putting it.

Magister Videtur quod contra eundem modum
ponendi potest aliter allegari. Nam, ut
allegatum est 1 huius c. 1, illud regimen est
expediens universitati mortalium, et eadem
ratione toti congregationi fidelium, per quod
iurgia et litigia ad quae prona est natura
mortalium aequius et convenientius

Master It seems that it can be argued in
another way against that same way of putting
it. For, as was argued in chapter one of the first
[book] of this [tractate], that rule is
advantageous to the totality of mortals, and
by the same argument to the whole
congregation of believers, through which
