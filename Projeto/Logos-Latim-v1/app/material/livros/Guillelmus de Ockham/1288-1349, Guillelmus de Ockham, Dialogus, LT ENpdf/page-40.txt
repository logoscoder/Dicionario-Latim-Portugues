errores quae vel qui antea haereses vel errores non
fuerunt. Secundo modo accipiendo haeresim non
dicuntur novae haereses nisi quia noviter sunt assertae,
sicut dictum est in responsione priori, et consimiliter de
multis erroribus potest dici.

such a disposition or act. If we take heresy and
likewise error in the first way, there can be many new
heresies and new errors which were not heresies or
errors before. If we take heresy in the second way,
heresies are not said to be new unless they have been
newly affirmed, as was said in the earlier reply, and a
similar thing can be said about many errors.

Discipulus Ut mihi videtur pertractata difficultas de
haeresibus novis magis est vocalis quam realis, et ideo
circa ipsam non amplius immoreris. Sed an aliter
obiiciatur contra descriptionem haeresis supradictam
noli celare.

Student It seems to me that the difficulty about new
heresies that has been investigated is more verbal than
real, and so would you not dwell upon it any longer.
But do not hide from me whether there is any other
objection to the above description of heresy.

Magister Per verba beati Hieronymi quae ponuntur 24,
q. 3, c. Haeresis dicta descriptio improbari videtur. Ait
enim, "Haeresis autem Graece ab electione dicitur,
quod scilicet eam sibi unusquisque eligat disciplinam
quam putat esse meliorem." Ex quibus verbis duo
dantur intelligi, quorum primum est quod ex quo
haeresis ab electione dicitur nullum falsum antequam
quis ipsum elegerit opinari vel dogmatizare aut
asserere debet inter hereses computari. Secundum est
quod cum non solum infideles sed etiam catholici et
fideles eligant disciplinam quam putant esse meliorem,
non solum assertiones infidelium sed etiam assertiones
fidelium debent haereses appellari. Et ex utroque
istorum concluditur quod descriptio haeresis saepedicta
est incongrue assignata.

Master That description seems to be disproved by the
words of blessed Jerome which are put in 24, q. 3, c.
Haeresis [col.997]. For he says, "Heresy is taken from
the Greek for 'choice', that is, that each person chooses
for himself that teaching which he thinks to be the
better." We are given to understand two things from
these words. The first is that from the fact that heresy
is taken from choice no falsity should be counted
among the heresies before someone chooses to
propound, opine or assert it. The second is that since
not only unbelievers but also catholics and believers
choose the teaching that they think is better, the
assertions not only of unbelievers but also of believers
should be called heresies. And we conclude from both
of these that the oft-cited description of heresy has
been unsuitably assigned.

Discipulus Ista obiectio fortis mihi videtur, sed
qualiter respondeatur ad ipsam non differas explicare.

Student That seems to me to be a strong objection,
but would you not delay explaining how reply is made
to it.

Magister Dicunt quod verba sanctorum sane
intelligenda sunt. Quorum intellectus saepe ex diversis
dictis eorum accipi debet, et ideo non semper
intelligenda sunt sicut in superficie sonant; et ideo
dicunt quod licet praedicta verba Hieronimi prima facie
videantur praetendere quod ante electionem actualem
nullum falsum debeat haeresis appellari et quod omnis
disciplina quam quis putat meliorem, sive sit vera sive
falsa, possit ad haeresim pertinere, non tamen sic
intelligit Hieronymus. Nam Hieronymus, scribens
praedicta verba super epistolam ad Galatas, inter
schisma et haeresim differentiam nititur assignare,
dicens, "Inter schisma et haeresim hoc esse arbitror
quod haeresis perversum dogma habeat, schisma post
episcopalem discessionem ab ecclesia pariter separat;"
et parum post, "caeterum nullum est schisma nisi sibi
aliquam haeresim confingit, ut recte ab ecclesia

Master They say that the words of the saints have to
be understood soundly. An understanding of them
often has to be taken from a variety of their writings
and so they should not always be understood in a
superficial sense. And therefore they say that although
the above words from Jerome seem prima facie to
allege that no falsity should be called a heresy before
there has been an actual choice and that every
teaching that someone thinks is better, whether it be
true or false, can pertain to a heresy, yet Jerome does
not understand them in this way. For in writing the
above words about the letter to the Galatians, Jerome
tries to mark out the difference between schism and
heresy by saying [in 24, q. 3, c. Inter heresim
(col.997)], "I think that there is this between schism
and heresy, that a heresy contains wrong teaching, a
schism likewise separates one from the church after an
