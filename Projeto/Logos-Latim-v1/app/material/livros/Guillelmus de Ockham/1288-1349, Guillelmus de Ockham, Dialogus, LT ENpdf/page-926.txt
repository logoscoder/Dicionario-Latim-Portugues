not established on the basis of those things
that can perhaps happen on one occasion. For
as sacred laws attest, legislators disdain what
is done once or twice. But it happens often
that the electors of the prelates of other
churches are deprived of their power to elect.
It never, or rarely, occurs, however, that the
electors of the supreme pontiff are deprived
of their power to elect. Although provision
should be made by the laws, therefore, about
by whom prelates should be set in authority
over other churches if those to whom election
has been granted are deprived of their power
to elect, it is nevertheless not reasonable that
laws make provision for how the Roman
pontiff should be elected if those to whom
election has been given are deprived of their
power to elect.

Magister Ista obiectio multos non movet
propter duo. primo {*om. &NaRe} Nam licet
iura saepius {*trs. &MzNaRe} aptentur ad ea
quae frequentius accidunt, tamen quandoque
{quotienscumque &Pe} iura aptantur
{*adaptantur &NaMzPeRe} ad ea quae raro
contingunt et maxime ubi periculum spirituale
{speciale &Pe} totius communitatis fidelium
vertitur nisi ius subveniat; sed si, privatur
{*privatis &NaRe} {privatus &Pe} potestate
eligendi illis quibus data est electio summi
pontificis, nullo iure neque divino neque
humano subveniatur {*subvenitur &MzNaRe}
ecclesiae ut possit habere summum pontificem,
spirituale periculum immineret {*imminet
&NaMzPeRe} toti ecclesiae. Ergo {igitur
&Na} si {*iste add. &MzNaRe} casus
contingat {*contigerit &MzNaRe} {contigeret
&Pe} aliquo iure subvenitur ecclesiae. Cum
igitur {*ergo &MzNaRe} super hoc {super
hoc om. &Mz} non inveniatur ius humanum,
recurrendum est ad ius divinum, ut scilicet
revertatur electio ad Romanos qui similiter

Master For two reasons that objection does
not move many people. For although laws are
more often applied to those things which
happen quite frequently, they are nevertheless
sometimes applied to those things which
happen rarely, especially where the whole
community of the faithful is threatened with
spiritual danger unless the law helps; but if
neither divine nor human law helps the
church so that it can have a supreme pontiff,
when those to whom the election of the
supreme pontiff has been given have been
deprived of the right to elect, [then] spiritual
danger threatens the whole church. If that
misfortune occurs, therefore, the church is
helped by some law. Therefore since no
human law is found concerning this matter
recourse must be had to divine law, namely
that election reverts to the Romans who have
the right to elect the supreme pontiff both by
divine law and the law of nations.
