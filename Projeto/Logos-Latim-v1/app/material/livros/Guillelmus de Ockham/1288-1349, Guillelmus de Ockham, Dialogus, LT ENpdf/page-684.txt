sine periculo non recipiuntur. Unde in eis maior

habent super literas examinatas aliquam

Papa conferat sibi imperium sed ne Papa et alii
habeant pro imperatore unum {*illum

gloss says, "Legates are not accepted
without danger. So a greater examination
is made of them.") And yet the office of a
legation is not from them (?the
examiners). It can not be proved by an
examination, therefore, that the one
examined has his office from the one
examining. It is even permitted to
examine papal letters (Extra, De crimine
falsi, c. Ad falsariorum [c.7, col.820]),
and yet examiners of this kind do not
have any power over the letters examined.
By the fact, therefore, that one elected as
emperor is examined by the pope it can
not be inferred that the emperor has the
empire from the pope. One elected as
emperor, therefore, is examined by the
pope not so that the pope may confer the
empire on him but so that the pope, and
others, do not have as emperor him who
was not elected legitimately and
consequently him who is not the true
emperor, just as those wanting to accept
papal letters examine them so that they do
not receive true letters for false ones.

Discipulus Video quare dicitur quod per
examinationem probari non potest quod
imperium sit a Papa. Nunc {nec &Re} refer
{refert &PeRe} quid dicitur de confirmatione.

Student I see why it is said that it can not
be proved that the empire is from the
pope because of examination. Now tell
me what is said about confirmation.

Magister Dicitur quod in nulla scriptura
autentica antiqua {om. &Pe} {quod add. &Md}

Master It is said that we do not find in
any authentic ancient writing that the
emperor was confirmed by the pope. So
in the decretal [Extra, De electione]
Venerabilem, which trumpets it forth that
the empire is from the pope, there is no
word about confirmation. So they say that
in former times the emperor was not
confirmed by the pope. If, however, later
on any [emperor] was confirmed by the
pope this resulted from the emperor's
simplicity and humility, yet he could not
