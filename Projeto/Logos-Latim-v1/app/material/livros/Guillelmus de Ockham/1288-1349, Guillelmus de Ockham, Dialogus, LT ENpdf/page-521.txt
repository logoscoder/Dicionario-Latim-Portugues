When, finally, he quotes blessed Peter's saying [not found in text above], "that he should exalt us to the salvation
prepared", etc., it must be said that Peter's text does not support him, because blessed Peter is speaking of whole
men, constituted of soul and body; and it is true that they will be exalted to clear vision on the day of judgment
and not (in the normal course of Providence) before then, because, although the souls of many clearly see God
before then, nevertheless men composed of body and soul will not (in the normal course of Providence) see God
before then.
And in this way almost all the texts are resolved that he brings forward for the above heresy in the two biggest
and most lengthy tracts, because they speak of the elect composed of body and soul, who (in the normal course
of Providence) will not see God before the day of judgment.
CHAPTER 3
The third way upon which he based himself is that, as he says,
the blessed vision is not consistent with learning [i.e. coming to know new things]. For whoever clearly sees God
also sees all things, according to Gregory, who says, &#8220;What does he not see who sees the one who sees
all things?&#8221; And consequently, [A passage seems to be missing: "And consequently, according to blessed
Gregory, whoever sees God face-to-face is not ignorant of any things that happen here among the living, nor are
they taught by anyone else, nor is anything revealed to them that they did not see before. But..." .Ballweg's
comment: Where does the missing passage come from? Is the backreference below the only hint?] according to
blessed Augustine, De cura pro mortuis, the souls of the saints do not of themselves know everything that
happens here among the living, but they become known to them either through souls newly deceased or dying, or
through the revelations of the angels who have care of the living, or through immediate revelation by God.
Since, therefore, they do not see all things, consequently also they do not clearly see God face-to-face.
This third argument of his is based on a manifest heresy, namely that clear vision of God cannot exist without
omniscience, or at least does not exist without omniscience, because it manifestly asserts that those who see God
are ignorant of nothing, therefore they know everything. But this is a heresy openly in conflict with divine
scripture. For the Apostle says, Ephesians, 3[:8-10], &#8220;To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace,
to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to enlighten everyone, so that they may see
what is the dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden from eternity in God who created all things, that
the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through
the Church&#8221;. From these words we gather manifestly that the holy angels before Christ&#8217;s
incarnation and passion were ignorant of some secrets concerning the incarnation of Christ; but the angels at that
time saw God; therefore not all who see God know everything, indeed they are ignorant of many things. But that
according to the Apostle&#8217;s meaning the holy angels who saw God were ignorant of some matters
concerning the mystery of the incarnation is manifestly asserted by the Gloss upon the above words, which says,
in the person of blessed Paul and explaining his words written above: &#8220;&#8217;Because it has been
given to me to preach, to enlighten, to see---what is this? Because through this something is added to the angels,
who learnt many secrets in these matters, and when he says &#8216;preach&#8217;, I say so that the manifold
wisdom of God concerning the restoration of mankind becomes known through the Church, which receives
God&#8217;s gifts, i.e. through the apostles in the Church preaching to principalities and powers, i.e. to the
various orders of angels who are in the heavens, i.e. in heaven, where also we will be. For blessed Jerome says
that the angelic offices did not understand purely concerning the mentioned mystery until Christ&#8217;s
passion was complete and the apostles&#8217; preaching spread among the peoples. Thus in Isaias 63[:1], the
angels marveling said, &#8216;Who is this, who comes from Edom?&#8217;, and in the Psalm [23:10],
&#8216;Who is this king of glory?&#8217;. Therefore, the &#8216;manifold wisdom&#8217; is revealed
through the Church not only to the patriarchs and prophets but also to the heavenly powers... Therefore the
wisdom of God is called &#8216;manifold&#8217; because in many ways it has many species and forms, which
the principalities and powers recognize through the Church.&#8221; From these words we gather evidently that
something was added through the Church to the angels who see God, and that they learn something through the
apostles&#8217; preaching the mystery of human redemption, which before the redemption and the passion and
the apostles&#8217; preaching they did not understand in its purity or fullness, and that manifold wisdom was
revealed through the Church to angels who see God, and that the angels did not know the multitude of wisdom.
All of this plainly implies that clear vision is indeed consistent with learning, and that not all who clearly see
God see everything, and that some who see God face-to-face are ignorant of some things, and some things are
taught to them, and something is revealed to them, and that it does not follow, &#8220;therefore they do not
clearly see God face-to-face&#8221;; all of these he openly denies in the above words.
But someone might say that the foregoing conflicts with Augustine, On Genesis. He says, speaking of the angels:
&#8220;The mystery of the kingdom of heaven is not hidden to them, which at an appropriate time has been
revealed for our salvation, by which, freed from this pilgrimage, we may be joined to their fellowship&#8221;.
But the Gloss, in the same place, answers this, and the Master of the Sentences, book 2, dist. 11 [para. 6, col.
674], to the same objection answers in the same way as the Gloss. For the Gloss says: &#8220;In case the
doctors of the sacred page, Jerome and Augustine, seem to contradict one another in the above opinions, what
