significatione, c. Super quibusdam verbis, ubi
Innocentius 3 enumerat sex genera hominum quos
asserit esse haereticos manifestos, videlicet contra
fidem publice praedicantes, profitentes errorem,
defendentes errorem, coram praelatis convictos,
confessos, et ab eis condemnatos de haeretica pravitate.
Verba autem Innocentii sane debent intelligi quia aliter
ex eis laberetur quis faciliter in errores.

significatione, c. Super quibusdam verbis [col.923],
where Innocent III enumerates six kinds of men
whom he asserts to be manifest heretics, namely those
preaching publicly against the faith, those professing
an error, those defending an error, those convicted
before prelates, those who have confessed before
them, and those condemned for heretical wickedness
by them. Innocent's words have to be understood
soundly, however, because otherwise someone would
easily slip into errors because of them.

De praedicantibus itaque publice contra fidem oportet
distinguere, quia quod aliquis praedicet publice contra
fidem quadrupliciter potest contingere. Uno modo quia
publice praedicat fidem christianam esse falsam,
dubiam, vanam vel incertam, et talis indubitanter est
haereticus manifestus quia talis sine pertinacia inveniri
non potest. Nam talis non est paratus corrigi per fidem
christianam si non reputat eam veram, certam et
sanam. Ergo pertinax et manifestus haereticus est
censendus. Aliter contingit aliquem praedicare publice
contra fidem praedicando aliquem errorem qui fidei
obviat christiane protestando quod nunquam ab
assertione sua desistet. Et talis est pertinax quia non est
paratus corrigi. Et ideo est haereticis sociandus. Tertio
contingit aliquem praedicare publice contra fidem
protestando quod nihil intendit contra fidem temere
defendere vel tenere. Et talis quia ostendit se esse
minime pertinacem et quod non errat ex malitia seu
pertinacia sed ex simplicitate et ignorantia non est
haereticus manifestus nec ex sola tali publica
praedicatione debet haereticus reputari. Et propter hoc
tales protestationes faciunt his temporibus quibus
quamplurimi ex odio, rancore, invidia et malitia
moliuntur meliores et sapientiores se de haeresi
diffamare quamplures docentes, praedicantes et
scribentes ut coram omnibus se ostendant nullatenus
pertinaces. Quarto contingit aliquem contra fidem
publice
praedicare
simpliciter
absque
omni
protestatione quod non intendit vel intendit aliquid
contra fidem temere defendere vel tenere. Et talis non
est censendus haereticus manifestus sed examinandus
est diligenter an pertinaciter adhaereat errori quem
publice praedicavit. Et si inventus fuerit pertinax debet
haereticus iudicari. Ante autem examinationem est
catholicus reputandus, quia quilibet reputandus est
bonus antequam contrarium sit aperte probatum. Et
ideo talis praedicans cum de adhaesione eius mentali
constare non possit est catholicus iudicandus quousque
probetur contrarium. Sicut enim ea quae dubium est
quo animo fiant in meliorem partem interpretari
debemus, ut habetur Extra, De Regulis iuris, c. Estote,
ita cum nescimus quo animo praedicat quis contra
fidem, animo scilicet pertinaciter adhaerendi vel animo
corrigendi se si erraverit, in meliorem partem
interpretari debemus, suspicando videlicet quod
paratus est corrigi cum veritas sibi fuerit manifesta.

And so it is necessary to make a distinction about [the
first kind, viz.] those preaching publicly against the
faith because it can happen in four ways that someone
preaches publicly against the faith: in one way
because he preaches publicly that the christian faith is
false, doubtful, groundless or uncertain, and such a
man is undoubtedly a manifest heretic because such a
man can not be found without pertinacity. For such a
man is not ready to be corrected by the christian faith
if he does not regard it as true, certain, and sound.
Therefore he should be considered pertinacious and a
manifest heretic. In another way it is possible for
someone to preach publicly against the faith,
preaching some error which is opposed to christian
faith and protesting that he will never desist from his
assertion. And such a man is pertinacious because he
is not ready to be corrected. And therefore he should
be associated with heretics. Thirdly it is possible for
someone to preach publicly against the faith while
protesting that he intends neither to defend rashly nor
to hold anything against the faith. And because such a
person shows that he is not pertinacious and that he is
not in error out of malice or pertinacity but because of
simplicity and ignorance he is not a manifest heretic
and he should not be regarded as a heretic only
because of such public preaching. And it is for this
reason that in these times in which very many people
try out of hatred, rancour, envy and malice to defame
those who are better and wiser than they are with [an
accusation of] heresy those who teach, preach and
write make such protestations to show before
everyone that they are not pertinacious. Fourthly, it is
possible for someone to preach publicly against the
faith simply, without any protestation that he does not
intend or does intend rashly to defend or to hold
anything against the faith. And such a person should
not be considered a manifest heretic but he should be
carefully examined about whether he clings
pertinaciously to the error which he publicly preached.
And if he is found to be pertinacious he should be
judged a heretic. Before his examination, however, he
should be regarded as catholic because anyone at all
should be regarded as good before the opposite has
been clearly proved. And so when it is not possible to
be certain about the mental clinging [to an error] of
such a person who preaches he should be adjudged
catholic until the opposite be proved. For just as we
