fundata, hanc concedunt quia omnis ecclesia catholica,
sive sit Romana, sive Pisana, sive Neapolitana, in
apostolica est radice fundata, quia in doctrina
apostolorum.

from an apostolic source, they grant this because
every catholic church, whether it is at Rome or at
Pisa or at Naples, has been founded from an apostolic
source since [it is founded] on apostolic teaching.

Cum vero allegat Augustinum respondetur per idem
quod ecclesiam constitutam in radice apostolice sedis
per successiones episcoporum, hoc est ecclesiam
tenentem doctrinam apostolicam quam rexerunt
succedentes episcopi, quamvis aliquando tale regimen
fuerit interruptum, et regent in futurum, licet forte cum
magna interrupcione regiminis, nulla malicia hominum
valebit extinguere. Et illa ecclesia, sive fuerit Rome,
sive Florencie, sive in Yspania, sive alibi, non poterit
esse nulla, quamvis omnes Romani et tota Ytalia ac
Francia et Yspania ac Alamania a fide catholica
recederet, quia si non fuerit in regionibus supradictis
erit in Syria, vel in Egipto, vel in Ethiopia, vel in India,
vel alibi ubi Deo placuerit.

When Augustine is quoted, it is replied in the same
way that no human evil will be able to destroy the
church founded from the source of the apostolic see
by successions of bishops, that is the church
maintaining the apostolic teaching and which
succeeding bishops have ruled -- even if sometimes
such rule has been interrupted -- and will rule in the
future, although perhaps with a large interruption in
rule. And that church, whether it is in Rome,
Florence, Spain or elsewhere, can not become null,
even if all the Romans and the whole of Italy, France,
Spain and Germany were to abandon the catholic
faith, because if it is not in those regions it will be in
Syria, in Egypt, in Ethiopia, in India or anywhere else
where God pleases.

Ad auctoritatem primam Hieronimi respondetur quod
beatus Hieronimus loquitur pro tempore preterito ante
tempora sua et non loquitur pro futuris temporibus. Et si
loqueretur pro futuris temporibus posset intelligi sane
quod loqueretur de ecclesia apostolica que fidem
sequitur apostolorum. Ad aliam auctoritatem Hieronimi
responsum est supra; que verba Hieronimi intelligenda
sunt sub condicione si beatus Petrus opem ferret, etc.

To the first text from Jerome the answer is that
blessed Jerome is talking about past time before his
own time and is not talking about the future. And if
he were talking about the future it could be
understood soundly that he was talking about the
apostolic church which follows the faith of the
apostles. A reply was given above to the other text
from Jerome, that his words should be understood
with the condition that if blessed Peter brings help
etc.

Capitulum 25

Chapter 25

Discipulus Satis quantum desidero pro opere isto
disseruimus de Romana ecclesia an valeat hereticari.
Ideo nunc de generali concilio conferamus an queat labi
in hereticam pravitatem.

Student: We have discussed as much as I want in
this work whether the Roman church can become
heretical. So let us now consider whether a general
council can fall into heretical wickedness.

CAN A GENERAL COUNCIL BECOME HERETICAL?
Magister De generali concilio sunt asserciones
contrarie. Una est quod hereticari non potest, alia est
quod heretica potest labe respergi.

Master: There are opposing assertions about a
general council, one that it can not become heretical,
the other that it can be defiled by the stain of heresy.

Discipulus Quamvis firmissime putem quod concilium
generale hereticari non potest, tamen raciones pro
assercione contraria libenti animo auscultabo.

Student: Although I most firmly believe that a
general council can not become heretical, I will
nevertheless listen with a willing mind to arguments
for the opposing assertion.

That a General Council can err
Magister Quod concilium generale possit errare contra
fidem racionibus et exemplis videtur posse probari.
Prima autem racio, que eciam ad alias asserciones
superius est inducta, talis est. Una sola ecclesia militans
236

Master: That a general council can err against faith
seems provable by arguments and examples. Now the
first argument, which was also brought forward
above in connection with other assertions, is as
