tractatoribus, sive magistri sive discipuli appellentur.
Multi enim qui vocantur discipuli in expositione
Scripturae Divinae sunt praeferendi magistris, et ideo
etiam pontificibus in huiusmodi praeferendi. Unde et
ratio Gratiani ita concludit de eruditis modernis sicut de
antiquis tractatoribus Scripturarum, quia eruditi his
temporibus scientia ampliori praecellunt. Ergo in
huiusmodi sunt episcopis et inquisitoribus, illiteratis et
simplicibus praeferendi.

is speaking of perceptive commentators on divine
scripture, whether they be called masters or students.
For many who are called students should be preferred
to masters in the exposition of divine scripture and
should also be preferred, therefore, to pontiffs in
matters of this kind. And thus Gratian's argument is as
conclusive about learned moderns as about ancient
commentators on the scriptures because the learned in
these times excel in greater knowledge; in matters of
this kind, therefore, they are to be preferred to
bishops and inquisitors, to the unlearned and simple.

Ad secundam tuam instantiam dicunt quod qua ratione
periti correcti a praelatis vel iurisdictionem habentibus
non tenentur suas opiniones erroneas revocare nisi
legitime fuerint ab eis modo memorato correcti, eadem
ratione nec simplices peritorum sequaces tenentur
opiniones quas a peritioribus acceperunt aliqualiter
revocare nisi fuerint correcti legitime. Ex quo sequitur
quod etiam alii simplices non tenentur, nisi legitime
correcti, suas opiniones erroneas revocare quia omnes
simplices consimili iure censeri videntur.

To your second objection they say that as with the
argument by which the learned corrected by prelates
or those having jurisdiction are not bound to retract
their erroneous opinions unless they have been
legitimately corrected by them in the aforesaid way,
so by that same argument the simple followers of the
knowledgeable are not bound to retract in any way
opinions which they have received from those who
are more knowledgeable unless they have been
legitimately corrected. From this it follows that other
simple people too are not bound to retract their
erroneous opinions unless they have been legitimately
corrected, because all simple people are seen to be
assessed by an exactly similar law.

Capitulum 17

Chapter 17

Discipulus Si habes plures rationes pro conclusione
praefata illas adducas?

Student If you have more arguments for the above
conclusion, please adduce them.

Magister Eadem conclusio secundo sic probatur.

Master The same conclusion is proved in a second
way as follows.

Qui in his quae fidei sunt non tenetur alteri fidem
indubiam adhibere, non tenetur ad solam assertionem
eius vel monitionem aut increpationem opinionem
erroneam revocare, quia qui opinionem erroneam
revocat debet assertionem contrariam firma fide tenere,
et eiusdem rationis videtur esse veritati catholicae
firmiter adhaerere et falsitati contrariae dissentire.

Whoever is not bound to demonstrate undoubting
trust in another in matters of faith is not bound to
retract an erroneous opinion solely on the assertion,
advice or chiding of that person, because whoever
retracts an erroneous opinion ought to hold the
contrary assertion with firm faith, and it seems to be
the same in essence to cling firmly to catholic truth
and to dissent from an opposing falsity.

Sed subditi in his quae fidei sunt non tenentur praelatis
suis fidem indubiam adhibere, tum quia tunc fides
subditorum in sapientia hominum consisteret, tum quia
prelati tam ex simplicitate vel ignorantia quam ex
pertinacia possunt contra fidem errare. Ergo ad solam
assertionem eorum vel monitionem seu increpationem
non tenentur suas subditi opiniones erroneas revocare.
Sed si revocare tenentur oportet quod praelati per
regulam fidei eis patenter ostendant quod opiniones
suae fidei obviant orthodoxae.

But in matters of faith subjects are not bound to
demonstrate undoubting trust in their prelates both
because then the faith of subjects would rest on the
wisdom of men and because prelates can err against
the faith both from simplicity or ignorance and from
pertinacity. Subjects are not bound to retract their
erroneous opinions, therefore, solely on their
[prelates'] assertion, advice or chiding. But if they are
bound to retract them, it is necessary that the prelates
clearly show them by the rule of faith that their
opinions conflict with orthodox faith.
