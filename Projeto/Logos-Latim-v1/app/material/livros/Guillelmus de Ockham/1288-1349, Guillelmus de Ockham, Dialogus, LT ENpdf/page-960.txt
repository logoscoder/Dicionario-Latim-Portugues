appear before each of them - and this is
impossible for him - or he will appear before
one only and then will do a wrong to the
other before whom he does not appear, since
he is not bound to appear before the one more
than before the other - and in return without
being at fault he will be punished for being
contumacious by the one before whom he
does not appear - or he will appear before
neither and then his crime will remain
unpunished. Also if each of those judges
sends his retainers to capture the guilty man,
either one or the other group of those
retainers will be disobedient to their lord, or
they will fight among themselves to lead the
guilty man back to the judge by force. While
they fight the guilty man will escape, and so a
dangerous sedition will arise among the
people or in the community and crimes will
remain unpunished. A community in which
such [problems] arise because of the power of
judges, therefore, is very badly governed. [cf.
Marsilius, I.xvii.3]

Amplius ex huiusmodi {*hac &NaRe}
pluralitate iudicum omnis utilitas publica et
reorum impeditur punitio {*trs. &NaRe}, quia
poterit contingere quod isti iudices voluerint
subditos ad diversa loca pro eodem tempore
pro criminosis plectendis vel pro {*om.
&NaRe} tractandis negociis quibus
{*communibus &NaRe} convocare. Non
possunt {*autem add. &NaRe} ad diversa loca
aut {*om. &NaRe} eodem tempore convenire.
Ergo et punitio malefactorum et communis
utilitas impeditur {*impedietur &MzNaRe} et
de facili seditio orietur. Quare talis
communitas est {*esset &NaRe} pessime et
periculosissime ordinata.

Further, [2] any public benefit and the
punishment of the guilty are hindered by this
plurality of judges because it could happen
that those judges wanted to assemble their
subjects at different places at the same time
to punish criminals or to discuss common
business. However, they can not assemble in
different places at the same time. Therefore
both the punishment of wrong-doers and the
common benefit will be hindered, and
sedition will easily arise. Therefore such a
community would be very badly and most
dangerously regulated.

Rursus absque necessitate et utilitate est
pluralitas fugienda quia frustra fit per plura
{*plures &NaRe} quod fieri potest {*trs.
&NaRe} per pauciora {*pauciores &NaRe}.
Sed pluralitas huiusmodi iudicum omni
necessitate aut {*et &NaRe} utilitate caret
quia omnia melius disponerentur

Again, [3] if there is no necessity and benefit
a plurality should be avoided because what
can be done by fewer people is done to no
purpose by many. But this sort of plurality of
judges lacks any necessity and benefit
because everything is better regulated by one
than by many. Because such a plurality easily
