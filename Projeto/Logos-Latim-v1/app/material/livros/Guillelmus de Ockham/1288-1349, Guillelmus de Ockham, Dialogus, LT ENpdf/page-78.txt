huiusmodi est nullatenus inhaerendum.

authority. But human authority should not be relied on
in matters of faith because our faith is above human
understanding. Therefore in matters of this kind we
should not adhere to human understanding.

Quinta ratio est haec. Omnes alii a papa in generali
concilio congregati non sunt maioris auctoritatis quam
fuerint apostoli et Moyses in veteri lege; sed apostoli et
Moyses doctrinam suam miraculis vel testimoniis
auctenticis ab auditoribus iam receptis, ut redderetur
credibilis, confirmaverunt nec aliter eis populi
credidissent. Ergo papa non tenetur illis adhibere fidem
qui nec miraculo nec testimonio catholicae veritatis
sibi notae faciunt eum de sua sententia certum. Si igitur
omnes alii in generali concilio nec miraculo nec
auctoritate catholica ostenderent papae assertionem
damnandam esse haereticam, non deberet papa ipsam
tamquam haereticam condemnare. Maior istius rationis
videtur aperta. Minor ostenditur manifeste per
exemplum de beato Paulo, qui doctrinam suam tam
miraculis quam Scripturarum testimoniis confirmavit.
Unde ad Romanos 15 ait, "Non enim audeo aliquid
loqui eorum quae per me non efficit. Christus in
obedientiam gentium, verbo et factis, in virtute
signorum et prodigiorum." Ex quibus verbis colligitur
quod beatus Paulus doctrinam suam signis et prodigiis
confirmavit. De Scripturarum testimoniis etiam quae
adduxit beatus Paulus patet ad Romanos 9 et 10 et 11
et 1 ad Corinthios 2 et 3, ad Hebreos 1, 2 et 3 et in
multis aliis locis epistolarum suarum. Quod etiam
omnes apostoli confirmaverint praedicationem suam
testatur Marcus in Evangelii sui capitulo ultimo dicens,
"Illi autem profecti praedicaverunt ubique, Domino
cooperante, et sermonem confirmante, sequentibus
signis." Beatus etiam Petrus, ut patet Actuum 1,
auctoritatibus receptarum scripturarum a Iudaeis coram
ipsis suam doctrinam confirmavit. Moysi quoque dixit
Dominus, ut legitur Exodi 4, "Si nec duobus quidem
signis his crediderint neque audierint vocem tuam,
sume aquam fluminis et funde eam super aridam et
quicquid hauseris de fluvio vertetur in sanguinem." Ex
quibus aliisque quampluribus patet aperte quod illi per
quos Deus docuit populum catholicam veritatem ad
confirmationem suae doctrinae vel Scripturarum
testimonia adduxerunt vel cooperatione miraculi
veritatem ostenderunt, nec eis aliter populi credere
artabantur.

A fifth argument is this. All the others gathered
together by the pope in a general council are not of
greater authority than were the apostles and, under the
old law, Moses; but, so that their teaching would be
rendered credible, the apostles and Moses confirmed it
with miracles or authentic testimonies already
accepted by their hearers, and the people would not
have believed them otherwise. Therefore the pope is
not bound to show faith in those who do not make him
sure about their opinion with a miracle or with the
testimony of a catholic truth known to him. If all the
others in a general council, therefore, were not to
show to the pope either with a miracle or with catholic
authority that an assertion should be condemned as
heretical, the pope ought not to condemn it as
heretical. The major [premise] of this argument seems
obvious. The minor [premise] is shown clearly by the
example of blessed Paul who confirmed his teaching
with both miracles and testimonies from the
scriptures. Whence he says in Romans 15[:18-9], "For
I dare not speak of any of those things which Christ
worketh not by me, for the obedience of the gentiles,
by word and deed, by the virtue of signs and
wonders." We gather from these words that blessed
Paul confirmed his teaching with signs and wonders.
That he also brought forward testimonies from the
scriptures is clear from Romans 9, 10 and 11, 1
Corinthians 2 and 3, Hebrews 1, 2 and 3 and many
other places in his letters. That all the apostles also
confirmed their preaching with miracles Mark attests
in the last chapter of his gospel [16:20] saying, "But
they going forth preached everywhere, the Lord
working withal, and confirming the word with signs
that followed." As is clear from Acts 1, blessed Peter
also confirmed his teaching before the Jews through
texts of the scriptures that they accepted. The Lord
also said to Moses, as we read in Exod. 4[:9], "But if
they will not even believe these two signs nor hear thy
voice, take of the river water and pour it out upon the
dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river
shall be turned into blood." It is quite clear from these
and very many others that those through whom God
taught people catholic truth either brought forward
testimonies from the scriptures to confirm their
teaching or demonstrated its truth by the working of a
miracle, and the people were not constrained to
believe them in any other way.

Discipulus Ista responsio videtur probare tantummodo
quod papa non tenetur sequi alios in damnando
haeresim quando nec miraculum faciunt nec pro se
Scripturam adducunt, sed si probant assertionem quam
petunt damnari esse haereticam videtur quod papa

Student That reply seems to prove only that the pope
is not bound to follow others in condemning a heresy
when they do not perform a miracle or bring forward
scripture in their support, but if they prove that the
assertion they are seeking to have condemned is
