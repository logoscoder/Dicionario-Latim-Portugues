of faith brought to him. Therefore, a question of faith
should be brought not to him who does err but to him
who can err against faith.

Ad terciam racionem dicitur quod ille scripture et
decretales pape inter scripturas canonicas, hoc est
autenticas et veneracione dignas, sunt recipiende que
Scripture Divine et sacris dogmatibus sanctorum
patrum non inveniuntur adverse; et de huiusmodi
sanccionibus scripturis et epistolis pape loquuntur
Augustinus et Agatho papa et alii sancti patres.
Scripture autem et epistole pape que sacre pagine aut
sacris dogmatibus contradicunt sunt a cunctis fidelibus
respuende, teste Graciano qui dist. 19, para. Hoc autem
ait, "Hoc autem", scilicet quod decretales sunt paris
auctoritatis cum canonibus, "intelligendum est de illis
sanccionibus vel decretalibus epistolis in quibus nec
precedencium patrum decretis nec evangelicis
preceptis aliquid contrarium invenitur. Et idem para.
Quia ergo ait, "Quia ergo illicite et non canonice sed
contra decreta predecessorum et successorum suorum
hec rescripta dedit," scilicet Anastasius secundus, "ut
probat Felix et Gelasius, qui Achacium ante
Anastasium excommunicaverunt, et Hormisda, qui ab
ipso Anastasio tercius eundem Achacium postea
dampnavit, ideo a Romana ecclesia repudiatur et a Deo
percussus fuisse legitur." Ex hiis verbis colligitur quod
papa potest scribere decretales que non sunt a
catholicis acceptande, quod quidem exemplo probare
conantur. Nam decretales seu rescripta Iohannis 22
decretalibus et rescriptis Gregorii 9, Innocencii 4,
Alexandri 4, Nicolai 3 et Clementis 5 ac quorundam
aliorum summorum pontificum, quantum ad ea que ad
dogmata fidei spectant, obviant et repugnant. Contraria
autem non sunt a catholicis recipienda; ergo vel scripta
Iohannis 22 vel predictorum summorum pontificum
sunt a catholicis respuenda.

It is said to the third argument that those papal
writings and decretals which are not found to be
opposed to divine Scripture and to the sacred
teachings of the holy fathers should be accepted as
canonical writings, that is as authoritative and worthy
of veneration. And it is about papal decrees, writings
and letters of this kind that Augustine, Pope Agatho
and other holy fathers speak. Papal writings and
letters, however, that contradict the sacred page or
sacred teachings should be rejected by all believers.
Gratian attests to this at dist. 19, para. Hoc autem
where he says [col.62], "But this,' namely that
decretals are of equal authority with the canons,
'should be understood of those decrees or decretal
letters in which nothing is found which is opposed to
the decrees of earlier fathers or to gospel teachings."
And in the same distinction at para. Quia ergo he says
[col.64], '"Therefore because he," that is Anastasius II,
"issued these rescripts impermissibly and not
canonically but against decrees of his predecessors
and successors - as Felix and Gelasius, who
excommunicated Achacius before Anastasius, and
Hormisda, third in line after Anastasius, who later
condemned the same Achacius, prove - he was as a
result repudiated by the Roman church and, as we
read, was slain by God." We gather from these words
that a pope can write decretals which should not be
accepted by catholics. Indeed they try to prove this by
an example. For on matters pertaining to the teachings
of faith the decretals or rescripts of John XXII oppose
and are contrary to decretals and rescripts of Gregory
IX, Innocent IV, Alexander IV, Nicholas III, Clement
V and some other highest pontiffs. However,
contraries should not be accepted by catholics. Either
the writings of John XXII, therefore, or the writings of
the aforesaid highest pontiffs should be rejected by
catholics.

Ad quartam racionem respondetur quod summo
sacerdoti in veteri lege et iudici oportebat omnes in
causis difficilibus et ambiguis obedire, quando iuxta
legem divinam veritatem iudicii indicabat. Si autem
contra legem divinam aliquid precepisset, non fuisset
obediendum eidem, sicut ex libro Deuteronomii c. 13
et 17 colligitur evidenter. Quod autem summi
sacerdotes veteris legis et eciam iudices principales
poterant contra legem Dei iubere et contra fidei
veritatem errare constat ex hoc quod plures eorum a
veritate iudicii et fidei deviarunt, sicut per exempla
plura posset ostendi, quia plures summi sacerdotes
circa tempora Machabeorum legem Domini
reliquerunt. Urias eciam sacerdos obediens regi Achax
contra legem extruxit altare, sicut habetur 4 Regum 16
c. Summi eciam sacerdotes tempore Christi in multis

The reply to the fourth argument is that under the old
law it was proper for everyone to obey the highest
priest and judge in difficult and doubtful questions
when he was declaring the truth of his judgement
according to divine law. If he had ordered something
against divine law, however, he ought not to have
been obeyed, as we evidently gather from chapters 13
and 17 of Deuteronomy. However, that the highest
priests under the old law and also the chief judges
could make orders against the law of God and err
against the truth of faith is certain from the fact that
many of them turned aside from the truth of
judgement and faith, as could be shown by many
examples, because many highest priests around the
time of the Maccabees abandoned the law of the Lord.
Indeed the priest Urias in obedience to King Achaz
