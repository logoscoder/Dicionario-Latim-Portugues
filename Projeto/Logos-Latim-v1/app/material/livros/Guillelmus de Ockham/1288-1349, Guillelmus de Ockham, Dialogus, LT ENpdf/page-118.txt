papa 22 quod ipse habet dicere et asserere ecclesiam
universalem errare, de quo aliquando tecum
collationem habebo, pro assertionibus contrariis
supradictis aliquas allegationes adducas?

pope John XXII the power to say and assert that the
universal church errs, about which I will sometime
have a discussion with you, would you bring forward
some arguments for the contrary assertions mentioned
above?

Magister Pro prima assertione potest taliter allegari:
fides Christiana est fides universalis ecclesiae, nec inter
fidem Christianam et fidem universalis ecclesiae potest
aliqua differentia reperiri. Qui ergo dicit ecclesiam
universalem errare vel errasse dicit fidem Christianam
esse erroneam; qui autem dicit fidem christianam esse
erroneam est statim absque ulteriori examinatione
pertinax et haereticus reputandus; ergo qui dicit
ecclesiam universalem errare vel errasse est statim
absque aliqua examinatione pertinax et haereticus
iudicandus.

Master For the first assertion it can be argued as
follows. The christian faith is the faith of the universal
church and no difference can be found between the
christian faith and the faith of the universal church.
He who says, therefore, that the universal church errs
or has erred is saying that the christian faith is
erroneous; he who says that the christian faith is
erroneous, however, should be regarded immediately
and without further examination as pertinacious and a
heretic; he who says that the universal church errs or
has erred, therefore, should be judged immediately
and without any examination pertinacious and a
heretic.

Pro assertione contraria taliter allegatur: qui dicit vel
tenet aliquam assertionem cuius contrariam non tenetur
explicite credere non est statim pertinax nec haereticus
iudicandus, quia qua ratione potest quis tenere unam
assertionem haereticalem cuius contrariam non tenetur
explicite credere absque hoc quod pertinax et
haereticus iudicetur, eadem ratione et aliam
quamcunque
assertionem
haereticalem
cuius
contrariam non tenetur explicite credere potest dicere et
tenere absque hoc quod statim debeat pertinax et
haereticus iudicari. Sed non quilibet Christianus tenetur
explicite credere quod ecclesia universalis non errat nec
erravit. Ergo quamvis aliquis dixerit quod ecclesia
universalis errat vel erravit non est statim pertinax et
haereticus iudicandus, sed examinandus est an paratus
sit corrigi.

For the contrary assertion it is argued as follows. He
who says or holds some assertion the contrary of
which he is not bound explicitly to believe should not
be judged immediately as pertinacious or a heretic,
because by whatever argument someone can hold,
without being judged pertinacious and a heretic, an
heretical assertion the contrary of which he is not
bound explicitly to believe, by the same argument he
can also assert and hold any other heretical assertion
the contrary of which he is not bound explicitly to
believe without his being bound to be judged
immediately pertinacious and a heretic. But not every
christian is bound explicitly to believe that the
universal church does not err and has not erred. Even
if someone has said, therefore, that the universal
church errs or has erred he should not be judged
immediately to be pertinacious and a heretic but
should be examined about whether he is ready to be
corrected.

Maior istius rationis videtur esse manifesta.

The major [premise] of this argument seems to be
obvious.

Minor probatur quia nullus tenetur explicite credere
conclusionem qui non tenetur explicite credere
antecedens vel praemissas propter quod vel quas
tenetur conclusio. Sed quod ecclesia universalis non
errat vel erravit est conclusio quae ideo credenda est
quia Christus dixit (Matthaei ultimo), "Vobiscum sum
omnibus diebus usque ad consummationem seculi", et
quia rogavit pro Petro ne deficeret fides eius. Ista
autem ex quibus infertur quod universalis ecclesia non
erravit nec errat multi non tenentur explicite credere
quia multi sunt illiterati qui verba praedicta nunquam
audiverunt. Ergo nec tenentur explicite credere quod
ecclesia universalis non errat nec erravit.

The minor is proved because no one is bound
explicitly to believe a conclusion unless he is bound
explicitly to believe the antecedent or the premises on
the basis of which the conclusion is maintained. But
that the universal church does not err and has not
erred is a conclusion, which should be believed
because Christ said, in the last Chapter of Matthew
[28:20], "I am with you all days, even to the end of
time", and because he asked on behalf of Peter that
his faith not fail. Many are not bound explicitly to
believe these words from which it is inferred that the
universal church has not erred and does not err
because many are unlearned and have never heard
them. They are not bound explicitly to believe,
