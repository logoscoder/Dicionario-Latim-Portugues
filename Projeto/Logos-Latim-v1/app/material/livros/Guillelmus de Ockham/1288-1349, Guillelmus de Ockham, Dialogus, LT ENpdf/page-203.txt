Magister Quod per Romanam ecclesiam congregacio
fidelium valeat importari ex scriptura nituntur ostendere.
Primo sic: omnis ecclesia Romanorum potest Romana
ecclesia appellari; sed omnes fideles possunt appellari
Romani. Unde et beatus Paulus extra totam Italiam natus
antequam Romam venisset se esse civem Romanum
asseruit (Actuum 16 c). Ergo tota congregacio fidelium
potest Romana ecclesia appellari.

Master: They try to show from scripture that the
congregation of believers can be meant by the
'Roman church'. Firstly as follows: every church of
Romans can be called the Roman church; but all
believers can be called Romans. And thus blessed
Paul who was born completely outside Italy
affirmed that he was a Roman citizen before he had
come to Rome (Acts 16[:37]). Therefore the whole
congregation of believers can be called the 'Roman
church'.

Secundo sic arguunt: illa ecclesia que non habet
maculam neque rugam neque aliud huiusmodi potest
Romana ecclesia appellari, teste Pelagio papa qui, ut
habetur dist. 21, c. Quamvis, loquens de Romana
ecclesia ait, "Est ergo prima apostoli Petri sedes Romana
ecclesia, non habens maculam neque rugam nec aliquid
huiusmodi." Ubi dicit glossa, "Argumentum quod
ubicumque sunt boni ibi est Romana ecclesia." Ex
quibus verbis datur intelligi quod tota congregacio
bonorum ubicumque sunt potest Romana ecclesia
appellari, et per consequens tota congregacio fidelium
potest Romana ecclesia appellari.

They argue secondly as follows. That church which
has neither stain nor wrinkle nor something other of
this kind can be called the Roman church, as Pope
Pelagius attests. Speaking of the Roman church, as
we find in dist. 21, c. Quamvis, he says [col.70], "So
the first see of the apostle Peter is the Roman church
which has neither stain, nor wrinkle nor any thing of
this kind." The gloss on this says [s. v. nec aliquid;
col.95], "Argument: wherever there are good people,
there is the Roman church." We are given to
understand by these words that the whole
congregation of good people, wherever they are, can
be called the Roman church and, as a consequence,
the whole congregation of believers can be called
the Roman church.

Discipulus Circa interrogacionem propositam considero
sentencias hominum multipliciter variari, de quibus duas
tantummodo pertractes ad presens. Primo enim allega
pro illa sentencia qua asseritur quod Romana ecclesia
que distinguitur a congregacione fidelium sicut pars a
suo toto non potest contra fidem errare. Postea pro
assercione contraria allegare coneris?

Student: I perceive that people's opinions about the
proposed question vary in many ways. Would you
investigate only two of them at the moment. Argue
first for that opinion which affirms that the Roman
church that is distinguished from the congregation
of believers as a part from its whole can not err
against faith. Would you later try to argue for the
opposing assertion?

(A) That the Roman Church that is part of the wider church can not err
Magister Quod ecclesia Romana que distinguitur a tota
congregacione fidelium sicut pars a suo toto contra
fidem errare non possit multis modis ostenditur. Primo
sic: illa ecclesia que voce evangelica Domini et
Salvatoris ceteris ecclesiis est prelata contra fidem errare
non potest, quia, ut habetur Actuum 5 c., "Opus Dei
dissolui non potest ab hominibus." Si autem illa ecclesia
que voce divina ceteris ecclesiis est prelata contra fidem
erraret, desineret esse caput aliarum ecclesiarum et ita
opus Dei dissolveretur. Sed Romana ecclesia que
distincta est contra alias ecclesias, et per consequens
contra totam congregacionem fidelium sicut pars contra
totum suum, voce Domini ceteris ecclesiis est prelata,
teste Pelagio papa qui, ut habetur dist. 21, c. Quamvis,
ait, "Quamvis universe per orbem catholice ecclesie
institute unus thalamus Christi sit, tamen sancta Romana
ecclesia catholica et apostolica nullis synodicis institutis

Master: That the Roman church which is
distinguished from the whole congregation of
believers like a part from its whole can not err
against faith is shown in many ways. Firstly as
follows: that church which has been preferred by the
words of the Lord and Saviour in the gospel to the
rest of the churches can not err against faith because,
as we find in Acts 5[:39], "If it be from God, you
can not overthrow it." If however that church which
has been preferred by divine word to the rest of the
churches were to fall into error the other churches
would be lacking a head and so the work of God
would be dissolved. But the Roman church which is
distinguished from other churches and consequently
the whole congregation of believers as a part from
its whole has been preferred by the word of the Lord
to other churches, as Pope Pelagius attests. As we
