excommunicate.
Hanc assertionem triplici ratione probare nituntur,
quarum prima est haec. Secundum Innocentium 3, ut
habetur Extra, De sententia excommunicationis, c. Per
tuas,
sententia
excommunicationis
continens
intolerabilem errorem non ligat; sed excommunicare
assertionem catholicam est intolerabilis error; ergo talis
sententia nullum ligat.

They try to prove this assertion by three arguments of
which this is the first. According to Innocent III, as
we find in Extra, De sententia excommunicationis, c.
Per tuas [col.906], a sentence of excommunication
that contains an intolerable error is not binding; but to
excommunicate a catholic assertion is an intolerable
error; therefore such a sentence binds no one.

Secunda ratio est haec: nullus potest cogi ad malum;
negare autem assertionem catholicam est de se malum;
ergo ad hoc per nullam sententiam potest quis cogi, et
per consequens sententia ad hoc cogens est nulla.
Sententia
autem
excommunicationis
qua
excommunicatur catholica veritas, quantum est ex
forma sententiae, cogit negare catholicam veritatem;
ergo talis sententia nulla est, et per consequens
neminem ligat.

The second argument is this: no one can be forced to
evil; to deny a catholic assertion, however, is of itself
evil; therefore no one can be forced to this by any
sentence, and consequently a sentence forcing
someone to this is null. However, a sentence of
excommunication by which a catholic truth is
excommunicated forces the denial of a catholic truth,
as far as a formal sentence can do; therefore such a
sentence is null and consequently is not binding on
anyone.

Tertia ratio est haec: sententia haeretici neminem ligat,
ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Audivimus; sed si dicta sententia
excommunicationis se extendebat ad catholicas
veritates, ferentes eandem sententiam fuerunt haeretici,
quia si dubius in fide est infidelis multo fortius
damnans sententialiter veritatem catholicam haereticus
est censendus; si autem ferentes dictam sententiam
fuerunt haeretici ipsa nullum omnino ligavit.

The third argument is this: the sentence of a heretic is
binding on no one, as we find in 24, q. 1, c.
Audivimus [col.967]; but if the said sentence of
excommunication extended to catholic truths those
imposing that sentence were heretics because, if
someone who doubts in a matter of faith is an
unbeliever, much more is it the case that he who
condemns a catholic truth in a sentence should be
considered a heretic; if those imposing the said
sentence were heretics, however, it did not bind
anyone at all.

Chapter 23

Discipulus
An
excommunicantes
ignoranter
assertionem catholicam sint censendi haeretici postea
diligenter inquiram, et ideo ad propositum revertaris et
quomodo ad praefatam instantiam de Universitate
Parisiensi aliter respondetur enarra.

Student I will carefully inquire later whether those
unknowingly excommunicating a catholic assertion
should be considered heretics, and so would you
return to the argument and tell me in what other way
reply is made to the above objection about the
University of Paris.

Magister Sunt quidam dicentes quod dicta universitas
multas assertiones temerarie excommunicavit, non quia
illas assertiones putent sapere catholicam veritatem sed
quia quomodo repugnent fidei orthodoxae non apparet.
Alii dicunt quod ideo dicta excommunicatio fuit
temeraria reputanda, quia excommunicantes potestatem
quam non habebant indebite usurparunt, et ideo iuste
fuit postea eadem sententia revocata. Adhuc est quarta
responsio, quod episcopus Parisiensis auctoritate
apostolicae sedis rite eandem tulit sententiam.
Damnare autem assertionem catholicam auctoritate
sedis apostolicae ad inferiorem summo pontifice potest
licite pertinere.

Master There are some people who say that the said
university excommunicated many assertions rashly,
not because they think that those assertions smack of
catholic truth but because it is not clear how they are
opposed to orthodox faith. Others say that the said
excommunication should have been considered rash
because those who pronounced the excommunication
usurped without just cause a power that they did not
have, and so it was just that the sentence was later
revoked. There is yet a fourth response, that the
bishop of Paris rightly imposed that sentence with the
authority of the apostolic see. To condemn a catholic
assertion with the authority of the apostolic see,
however, can licitly pertain to someone inferior to the
