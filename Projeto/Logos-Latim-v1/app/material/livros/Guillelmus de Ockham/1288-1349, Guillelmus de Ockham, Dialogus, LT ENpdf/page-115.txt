Discipulus Vellem scire rationem quare talis debet
statim haereticus et pertinax reputari, cum ita possit
quis ambitione vel cupiditate tractus verbo et facto
ostendere se non tenere firmiter fidem Christianam
esse veram, quam tamen in mente tenet esse veram,
sicut potest quis hoc simulare metu mortis.

Disciple I would like to know the reason why such a
person should [not] be regarded at once as a heretic and
pertinacious since anyone influenced by ambition or
greed can show in this way by word or deed that he does
not firmly hold that the christian faith is true yet hold in
his mind that it is true, just as anyone can pretend this
out of fear of death.

Magister Ratio assignatur quia cum quis extra
metum mortis aliquid dicit aut facit plus habet de
voluntario quam quando dicit aut facit aliquid metu
mortis inductus. Et ideo nulla cupiditas vel ambitio
excusat de pertinacia in licito iudicio hominem
quemcunque facto vel verbo monstrantem se fidem
Christianam firmiter non tenere. Et eodem modo
dicitur quod nec amor nec odium nec aliquid praeter
timorem mortis potest quemcunque in hoc casu
excusare quin sit haereticus reputandus, nisi dicatur
quod per gravia illata tormenta vel metum eorum in
hoc casu quis valeat excusari.

Master The reason given is that when someone says or
does something other than from fear of death it is more
voluntary than when he says or does something
persuaded by fear of death. Greed or ambition,
therefore, does not in licit judgement excuse of
pertinacity any man showing by deed or word that he
does not firmly hold the christian faith. In the same way
it is said that neither love nor hate nor anything except
fear of death can excuse someone in this situation of
being regarded as a heretic, unless it is said that
someone can be excused in this situation because of the
inflicting of severe tortures or fear of them.

Discipulus Nunquid modo praedicto est dicendum
de omni scienter haeretico?

Disciple Should the same thing said about everyone who
is knowingly a heretic?

Magister: De omni
intelligenda praedicta.

Master These remarks should be understood of
everyone who is knowingly a heretic.

Capitulum 6.

Chapter 6.

Discipulus Sufficiat dixisse praedicta de primo modo.
Dic nunc secundum modum quo valeat de pertinacia
quis convinci.

Disciple Let what was said above be enough about
the first way; describe now a second way by which
someone can be convicted of pertinacity.

Magister Qui dicit aliquam partem Novi aut Veteris
Testamenti aliquod falsum asserere aut non esse
recipiendam a catholicis est pertinax et haereticus
reputandus. Unde propter hoc fuerunt Manichei
haeretici iudicati, qui Vetus Testamentum respuerunt et
Novum Testamentum pro parte tantummodo
receperunt.

Master He who says that some part of the New or
Old Testament asserts something false or should not
be accepted by catholics should be regarded as
pertinacious and a heretic. It was for this reason that
the Manichees, who rejected the Old Testament and
accepted the New Testament only in part, were
condemned as heretics.

Discipulus Nunquid si aliquis laicus qui de libro forte
Iosue nunquam audivit fieri mentionem diceret eundem
librum Iosue ad Vetus Testamentum minime pertinere
esset censendus haereticus?

Disciple Should some layman be considered a heretic
if he has never heard any mention of the book of, say,
Joshua and were to say that the book of Joshua does
not belong to the Old Testament?

Magister Differentia est inter dicentem aliquam
scripturam ad Vetus vel Novum Testamentum minime
pertinere et dicentem aliquam partem Novi vel Veteris
Testementi non esse recipiendam.

Master There is a difference between one saying that
some writing does not belong to the Old or the New
Testament and one saying that some part of the New
or the Old Testament should not be accepted.

Primus, si est laicus vel illiteratus non est statim
censendus haereticus sed est diligenter examinandus et
etiam instruendus. Et si post informationem

In the first case, if it is a layman or someone
unlearned, he should not immediately be considered a
heretic but should be carefully examined and also
