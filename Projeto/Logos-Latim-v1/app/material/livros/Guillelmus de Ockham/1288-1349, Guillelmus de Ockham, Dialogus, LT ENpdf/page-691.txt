Discipulus Nunquid tenebatur Otho etiam non
{*om. &MzNaPeRe} requisitus {non

{*om. &NaRe} Papae {*Johanni add.
&MzNaRe}?

Student Was Otto bound, especially if
asked, to swear to Pope John?

Magister Respondetur quod Otho spontanea
voluntate iuravit Papae Iohanni {om. &NaRe}
{*et add. &MdMzNaPeRe} ad tale autem
iuramentum cogi {colligi &Re} [[constringi:
interlinear Re]] non potuit. Quod tali ratione
probatur {?probat &Na}. Nam {*om.
&MdNaPeRe} Non plus ex ordinatione Christi
tenetur imperator papae pro Romano imperio
quam rex Franciae et quicunque alii pro regnis
suis {trs. &Md} {om. &Pe}. Sed rex Franciae et
multi alii reges non tenentur iurare Papae nisi
voluerint. Ergo nec imperator. Et ex hoc
concluditur quod imperator non [[et ex ... non:
margin Md]] habet imperium a Papa nec est
vasallus eius quia vasallus tenetur iurare domino
suo {etc add. &Pe} potissime si fuerit requisitus
{potissime si fuerit requisitus om. &MdPe}.

Master The reply is that Otto swore to
Pope John of his own free will, and could
not, nevertheless, have been forced to an
oath of that kind. This is proved by the
following argument. By Christ's
ordination the emperor is no more bound
to the pope for the Roman empire than
the king of France and any other [kings]
are for their kingdoms. But the king of
France and many other kings are not
bound to swear to the pope unless they
want to. Neither, therefore, is the
emperor. And from this we can conclude
that the emperor does not have the empire
from the pope and is not his vassal,
because a vassal is bound to swear to his
lord, above all if it is demanded of him.

CAP. XXII

CHAPTER 22

Discipulus Tange breviter aliquas {om. &Mz}
alias {om. &Pe} rationes pro saepe dicta
opinione.

Student Touch briefly on some other
arguments for that often quoted opinion.

Magister Alia ratio est {*haec add. &NaRe}.
{alia ratio est om. &Pe} Papa supplet defectum
imperii vacante imperio, Extra, De foro
competenti, c. {om. &MdNaRe} Licet. Ergo
imperium dependet a Papa.

Master [5] Another argument is this. The
pope makes good the deficiency in the
empire when there is a vacancy, Extra,
De foro competenti, c. Licet c.2, col.250].
Therefore the empire is derived from the
pope.

Discipulus Dic breviter {Dic breviter om. &Md}
quomodo respondetur ad illam {*istam
&NaPeRe} rationem {*trs. &MzNaRe}.

Student Tell me briefly how that
argument is replied to.

Magister Dicitur quod sicut Papa ex auctoritate
sibi data a {domino seu add. &Pe} Christo non

Master It is said that just as by the
authority given to him by Christ the pope
