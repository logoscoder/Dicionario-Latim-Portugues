Cui {qui &Re} concordare videtur Anitius
{*Anterus &NaRe} {Altius &Mz} papa qui
eadem {*eisdem &MzNaRe} causa {capitulis
&Mz} 9 {*et q. &MzNaRe} c. Si autem ait, c.
{*om. &MzNaRe} "Si autem aliquis
metropolitanorum inflatus fuerit et sine
omnium comprovincialium {provincialium
&Na} praesentia vel consilio episcoporum vel
causas eorum vel eas {*vel eas: aut alias
causas, nisi eas causas &MzNaReZn} tantum,
quae ad propriam suam pertinent parrochiam,
agere aut gravare eos voluerit, ab omnibus
districte corrigatur ne talia deinceps
praesumere audeat. Si vero incorrigibilis
eisque inobediens apparuerit, ad hanc
apostolicam sedem, cui {dum &Mz} {omnium
add. &NaRe} {*omnia add. &Zn}
episcoporum iudicia referri praecepta sunt,
eius contumacia referatur ut de eo vindicta
fiat." Ex praedictis {*quibus &NaRe}
colligitur quod minor potest supplere
negligentiam maioris.

Pope Anterus seems to agree with this. In the
same causa and quaestio c. Si autem he says,
"However, if any metropolitan is haughty
and, without all his provincials present or
without the advice of his bishops, wants to
treat either their cases or other cases, with the
exception only of those cases which pertain
to his own parish, or wants to oppress them,
let him be severely corrected by all of them
so that he will not dare to undertake such
things thereafter. Certainly if he appears
incorrigible and disobedient to them, let his
contumacy be referred to this apostolic see, to
which all the judgements of bishops have
been ordered to be referred, so that
punishment may be inflicted on him." We
gather from these that a lesser can make good
the negligence of a greater.

Et ideo non semper ille qui potest causam
vitiatam sublevare est maior, et per consequens
non potest semper {super &Mz} appellari ad
ipsum. Quare licet papa suppleat negligentiam
iudicum secularium, et {*etiam &NaRe} si
suppleret negligentiam imperatoris terminando
causam quam imperator terminare negligeret
{neglexerit &Re}, non posset per hoc ostendi
{*nec add. &NaRe} quod ab imperatore liceat
appellare ad papam nec quod imperator in
talibus sit minor papa.

And therefore it is not always the one who is
greater who can alleviate a faulty case, and
consequently there can not always be appeal
to him. Even if the pope makes good the
negligence of secular judges, therefore, even
if he were to make good the negligence of the
emperor by concluding a case which the
emperor neglected to conclude, it could not
be shown by this either that appeal is
permitted from the emperor to the pope or
that the emperor is less than the pope in such
matters.

Discipulus Quod minor valeat supplere
negligentiam superioris, hoc non est nisi
auctoritate canonis conditi a concilio quod est
superiius illo inferiori qui potest supplere
negligentiam superioris, Extra, De concessione
praebendarum, Quia diversitatem. Sed papa
auctoritate talis canonis vel legis non supplet
negligentiam iudicum secularium vel
imperatorum {*imperatoris Re} sed auctoritate
propria. Ergo ex officio maior est imperatore
in talibus et etiam {*om. &NaRe} omnibus

Student That a lesser can make good the
negligence of his superior is only by the
authority of a canon produced by a council
which is superior to that inferior who can
make good the negligence of his superior
(Extra, De concessione praebendarum, c.
Quia diversitatem [c.5, col.489]). But it is not
by the authority of such a canon or law that
the pope makes good the negligence of
secular judges or of the emperor, but it is by
his own authority. He is, therefore, by virtue
