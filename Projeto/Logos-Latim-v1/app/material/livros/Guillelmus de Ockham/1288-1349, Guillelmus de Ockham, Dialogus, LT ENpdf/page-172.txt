aliis summis pontificibus qui sibi circa rerum
contingenciam contradicunt. Nam Iohannes 22
dogmatizat et predicat quod omnia de necessitate
eveniunt quia omnia preordinata sunt a Deo; ordinacio
autem Dei impediri non potest. Unde et propter hoc in
constitucione sua Quia vir reprobus tenet expresse
quod Christus inquantum homo regno temporali et
universali rerum dominio renunciare non potuit quia
contra ordinacionem Patris fecisset. Propter hoc eciam
distinccionem theologorum de potencia Dei absoluta et
ordinata reprobat et impugnat. Propter hoc eciam dicit
quod Deus necessario predestinavit electis vitam
eternam et minime contingenter, et ita plane tenet quod
omnia de necessitate eveniunt. Cui tamen plures summi
pontifices contradicunt. Ait enim Iohannes papa 8, ut
habetur dist. 86, c. Facientis, "Facientis proculdubio
culpam habet qui quod potest corrigere negligit
emendare." Ex quibus verbis colligitur evidenter quod
quandoque aliquis non corrigit quos potest corrigere et
ita potest corrigere et potest non corrigere; quare non
omnia de necessitate eveniunt.

other highest pontiffs who disagree with each other
about the contingency of events. For John XXII
teaches as dogma and preaches that everything
happens of necessity because everything has been
preordained by God; but God's ordinance can not be
prevented. Whence and for this reason he expressly
maintains in his constitution, Quia vir reprobus, that
Christ, as a man, could not have renounced a temporal
kingdom and universal lordship of things because he
would have acted against the Father's ordinance. For
this reason too he rejects and opposes the theologians'
distinction between God's absolute and ordinate
power. For the same reason he also says that God has
necessarily, and not contingently, predestined the
elect to eternal life and so he plainly maintains that
everything happens of necessity. Yet many highest
pontiffs deny this. For as we find in dist. 86, c.
Facientis [col.298], Pope John VIII says, "He who
fails to amend what he is able to correct undoubtedly
shares the blame of the one acting." We clearly gather
from these words that sometimes someone does not
correct those whom he should correct; and so he is
able to correct and able not to correct; therefore not
everything happens of necessity.

Item Gregorius papa ut habetur dist. 83, c. Consentire
ait: "Consentire videtur erranti qui ad resecanda que
corrigi debent non occurrit." Ex quibus verbis datur
intelligi quod potest quis non corrigere que tamen
debet, et per consequens potest corrigere et potest non
corrigere.

Again, as we find in dist. 83, c. Consentire [col.294],
Pope Gregory says, "He who does not attend to the
curtailing of those things which should be corrected
seems to be in agreement with the one who errs." We
are given to understand by these words that it is
possible for someone not to correct what nevertheless
he ought [to correct]; and as a consequence he is able
to correct and he is able not to correct.

Item Leo papa ut habetur Extra, De hereticis, c. Qui
alios ait, "Qui alios cum potest ab errore non revocat",
etc.

Again, as we find in Extra, De hereticis, c. Qui alios
[col.778], Pope Leo says, "He who does not call
others back from error when he can do so", etc.

Item Eleutherius papa ut habetur 2, q. 7, c. Negligere
ait, "Negligere quippe cum possis perturbare perversos
nichil aliud est quam fovere."

Again, as we find in 2, q. 7, c. Negligere [col.501],
Pope Eleutherius says, "To neglect to disturb the
wicked when you can do so is indeed nothing other
than to favour them."

Item Innocencius 3 ut habetur Extra, De sentencia
excommunicationis, c. Quante ait: "Facientes et
consencientes pari pena plectendos catholica dampnat
auctoritas, eos delinquentibus favere interpretans qui
cum possint manifesto facinori desinunt obviare."

Again, as we find in Extra, De sententia
excommunicationis, c. Quante [col.909], Innocent III
says, "Catholic authority condemns those who act and
those who agree with them to be punished with the
same penalty, inferring that those who fail to oppose
manifest villainy when they can do so are favouring
the villains."

Item Innocencius papa, ut habetur dist. 83, c. Error,
eadem verba ponit cum Eleutherio dicens, "Negligere
quippe cum possis perturbare perversos", etc.

Again, as we find in dist. 83, c. Error [col.293], Pope
Innocent uses the same words as Eleutherius, saying,
"To neglect to disturb the wicked when you can", etc.

Item Simachus papa ut habetur eadem dist. para. 1. ait,

Again, as we find in the same dist. para. 1 [col.293],
