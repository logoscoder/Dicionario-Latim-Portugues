Quarto sic. Non minoris auctoritatis, dignitatis,
sanctitatis, firmitatis fidei est putandus summus
pontifex in nova lege quam fuerit summus sacerdos vel
iudex in veteri lege; sed summus sacerdos vel iudex in
veteri lege tante fuit firmitatis et auctoritatis habendus
quod nulli licebat de eius diffinicione aut iudicio in
quacumque causa ardua dubitare vel ei aliqualiter
contraire, teste ipso Deo qui, ut habetur Deuteronomii
17 c., dixit populo universo, "Si difficile et ambiguum
apud te iudicium esse perspexeris [...] et iudicium intra
portas tuas videris verba variari, surge et ascende ad
locum quem elegerit Dominus Deus tuus. Veniesque ad
sacerdotes Levitici generis et ad iudicem qui fuerit illo
tempore, queresque ab eis qui indicabunt tibi iudicii
veritatem. Et facies quodcumque dixerint qui presunt
loco quem elegerit Dominus Deus tuus et docuerint te
iuxta legem eius. Sequerisque sentenciam eorum, nec
declinabis ad dextram vel ad sinistram. Qui autem
superbierit, nolens obedire sacerdotis imperio qui eo
tempore ministrat Domino Deo tuo, et decreto iudicis,
morietur homo ille et auferes malum de Israel.
Cunctusque populus audiens timebit ut nullus deinceps
intumescat superbia." Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod
in veteri lege dignus erat morte qui in quacumque
questione difficili et ambigua sacerdotis et iudicis
imperio minime obedisset. Ex quo sequitur quod nulli
licebat dubitare an sacerdos et iudex recte diffinisset.
Ergo multo magis in nova lege, que perfecciores
noscitur habere ministros, nulli licet dubitare catholico
an papa in questione fidei recte diffiniat. Quod non
esset verum si papa contra fidem posset errare.

A fourth [argument is] as follows. The highest pontiff
under the new law should not be thought of as of less
authority, dignity, sanctity or strength of faith than
was the highest priest or judge under the old law; but
the highest priest or judge under the old law was to be
considered of such strength and authority that on any
difficult question no one was permitted to doubt his
definition or judgement or to oppose it in any way.
God himself testified to this, as we find in
Deuteronomy 17 [:8-13], when he said to all the
people, "If thou perceive that there be among you a
hard and doubtful matter in judgement ... and thou see
that the words of the judges within thy gates do vary,
arise and go up to the place which the Lord thy God
shall choose,. And thou shalt come to the priests of
the Levitical race and to the judge that shall be at that
time, and thou shalt ask of them, and they shall show
thee the truth of the judgement. And thou shalt do
whatsoever they shall say that preside in the place,
which the Lord your God shall choose, and what they
shall teach thee according to his law; and thou shalt
follow their sentence; neither shalt thou decline to the
right hand nor to the left hand. But he that will be
proud and refuse to obey the commandment of the
priest who ministereth at that time to the Lord thy
God and the decree of the judge, that man shall die
and thou shalt take away the evil from Israel. And all
the people hearing it shall fear, that no one afterwards
swell with pride." We gather from these words that
under the old law anyone who did not obey the
command of the priest and judge about any difficult or
doubtful question at all was worthy of death. It
follows from this that no one was permitted to doubt
whether a priest and judge had made a correct
determination. It is much more the case, therefore,
under the new law, which is known to have more
perfect ministers, that no catholic is permitted to
doubt whether the pope makes a correct determination
on a question of faith. This would not be true if the
pope were able to err against faith.

Discipulus Auctoritas Deuteronomii allegata non
videtur esse ad propositum quia illa non loquitur de
causa fidei sed de causis aliis civilibus et criminalibus.

Student: The text from Deuteronomy that you have
brought forward does not seem to be to the point
because it does not speak about a question of faith but
about other civil and criminal questions.

Magister Hoc non impedit racionem, quia ille de cuius
iudicio in causis civilibus et criminalibus non est
aliqualiter dubitandum de eius eciam iudicio in causa
fidei est nullatenus trepitandum. Nam qui in huiusmodi
causis non potest errare eciam in causa fidei errare non
poterit, eo quod omnis qui contra fidem potest errare et
in aliis poterit deviare, cum errantibus in fide etiam in
aliis minime sit credendum, quia, sicut sacri canones
protestantur, infideles et heretici nec iudicare nec
testimonium ferre in causis fidelium valent quoquo
modo.

Master: This does not hinder the argument because
there should be no anxiety about the judgement in a
question of faith of that one whose judgement should
not in any way be doubted in civil and criminal
questions. For whoever can not err in questions of this
kind also will not be able to err in a question of faith
because anyone who can err against faith will also be
able to go astray in other [questions], since those who
err in faith should also not be believed on other
[questions] because, as the sacred canons testify,
unbelievers and heretics can in no way at all make a
judgement or offer testimony in cases concerning
