faith they should be punished as if they had truly been
baptized.
Per tertiam vero particulam, cum dicitur "pertinaciter
dubitans vel errans contra Catholicam veritatem",
excluduntur omnes qui ex simplicitate vel ignorantia
sola, absque omni pertinacia, vel dubitant vel errant
contra fidem. Tales enim non sunt censendi haeretici,
sed sunt de fide cum diligentia informandi; qui si postea
pertinaciter dubitaverint vel erraverint sunt haeretici
iudicandi.

By the third element, when it is said, "who errs or
doubts pertinaciously against Catholic truth", are
excluded all those who either doubt or err against the
faith from simplicity or ignorance alone, without any
pertinacity. For such persons should not be considered
heretics, but should be diligently informed about the
faith, and if afterwards they doubt or err pertinaciously
they should be condemned as heretics.

Capitulum 4

Chapter 4

Discipulus Ut materiam de haereticis magis intelligam,
contra praedictam descriptionem multis modis obiciam.
Prima enim particula, quae ponitur loco generis, cum
dicitur "serio baptizatus", non videtur convenienter
poni. Quia multi sunt serio baptizati extra formam
ecclesiae qui, quantumcunque erraverint pertinaciter,
non sunt haeretici iudicandi secundum quod nunc
loquimur de haereticis, quia nunc solummodo loquimur
de haereticis qui sunt de foro ecclesiae et per ecclesiam
iudicandi. Illi autem qui sunt extra ecclesiam et
nunquam fuerunt de ecclesia nec unquam fuerunt
Christiani non sunt per ecclesiam iudicandi, teste
Apostolo, qui 1 ad Corinthios, 5 c., ait: "Quid enim
mihi de his qui foris sunt iudicare?" Sed baptizati extra
formam ecclesiae semper fuerunt foris et nunquam
fuerunt Christiani; ergo non sunt per ecclesiam
iudicandi, et per consequens non sunt haeretici
reputandi.

Disciple So as to understand better the material about
heretics I will object against the above description in
many ways. For the first element, which is put in place
of a genus, when it is said "seriously baptized", does
not seem suitably laid down. For many are seriously
baptized outside the Church's form, who, however
much they may err pertinaciously, should not be judged
heretics as we are now speaking of heretics, because
we are speaking now only about heretics who belong to
the forum of the Church and are to be judged by the
Church. But those who are outside the Church and
never were of the Church and never were Christians
should not be judged by the Church, as the Apostle
testifies. In 1 Corinthians 5, he says, "For what
business is it of mine to judge those outside?" But those
baptized outside the Church's form have always been
outside and never have been Christians. Therefore they
should not be judged by the Church and consequently
should not be regarded as heretics.

Magister Obiectio tua in aequivocatione fundatur, nam
variis modis aliqui dicuntur esse foris. Quidam enim
sunt foris quia nunquam, neque vero neque falso
baptismo, baptizati fuerunt nec pro baptizatis
qualitercunque se gesserunt, et de his intendit
Apostolus. Quia isti, quantumcunque pertinaciter
erraverint contra Catholicam veritatem, non sunt per
ecclesiam, sicut haeretici baptizati, plectendi.

Master Your objection is based on an equivocation, for
people are said to be "outside" in various ways. For
some are outside because they have never been
baptized, by either true or false baptism, and have not
in any way behaved as baptized persons, and the
Apostle means these. However much they err
pertinaciously against Catholic truth, they are not to be
punished by the Church, as baptized heretics are.

Alii sunt foris qui nunquam verum baptismum
acceperunt; habuerunt tamen falsum baptismum, vel se
pro baptizatis gesserunt, et isti, sicut illi qui fuerunt
intus, iudicio ecclesiae sunt subiecti.

Others are outside who never received true baptism;
however, they have received false baptism, or have
behaved as baptized persons; and these, like those who
have been within, are subject to the jurisdiction of the
Church.

Alii sunt foris qui aliquando intus fuerunt sed per
censuram ecclesiae sunt ab eadem ecclesia separati; et
tamen aliquando manent intus. Et sic omnes
excommunicati dicuntur foris. Hinc Hieronymus, ut
habetur 24, q. 3, c. Si quis, ait: "Fit interdum ut ille qui
foris mittitur intus sit, et ille foris qui intus videtur
retineri" [c. 4, col. 990]. Isti etiam, quantumcunque sint
foris, a iudicio ecclesiae minime sunt exempti.

Others are outside who have at some time been inside
but are separated from the Church by the Church's
censure; and nevertheless sometimes they remain
within. And in this way all excommunicates are said to
be outside. Thus Jerome, as we read in 24, q. 3, c. Si
quis, says: "It happens sometimes that he who is sent
outside is inside, and he is outside who seems to be
retained within". Those also, however much they are
outside, are not at all exempt from the Church's
jurisdiction.
