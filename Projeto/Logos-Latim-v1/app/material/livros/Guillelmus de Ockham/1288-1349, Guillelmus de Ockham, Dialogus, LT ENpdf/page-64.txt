articulos condemnatos et acta Ordinis saepedicti ac
etiam doctrinam praefati Petri de qua dicti articuli sunt
accepti haberem. Tu autem scis quod nullum habeo
praedictorum, et forte illi de Ordine nollent mihi
communicare eadem.

had the condemned articles, the acts of the above
Order and also the teaching of Peter from which the
said articles have been taken. You know, however,
that I have none of those and perhaps the members of
the Order would refuse to share them with me.

Capitulum 26

Chapter 26

Discipulus Ex quo istam ultimam sententiam declarare
non potes, declarationem eiusdem usque ad aliud
tempus, si forte praedicta ab eodem Ordine habere
potueris, differamus, et dic an aliqui teneant quod
aliquis inferior summo pontifice possit interdicere et
praecipere assertiones aliquas non teneri, licet eas
damnare non possit.

Student Because you can not make that last opinion
clear let us defer its clarification until another time, if
by chance you can get the above things from that
Order. [See Significant Variants, para. 6.] And tell me
whether anyone holds that someone inferior to the
highest pontiff can forbid some assertions and order
them not to be held, even if he can not condemn them.

Magister Sunt nonnulli putantes quod licet nec aliquod
collegium inferius concilio generali nec aliquis inferior
summo pontifice
valeat
licite
quamcumque
assertionem non damnatam explicite tamquam
haereticam excommunicare vel damnare, licet tamen
collegiis aliis et praelatis inferioribus papa assertiones
erroneas ex causa rationabili interdicere et praecipere
quod nullatenus publice defendantur. Et ideo dicunt
quod si Universitas Parisiensis et Cantuarienses
archiepiscopi saepefati ex causa rationabili opiniones
Thomae interdixissent, tantummodo praecipiendo quod
publice eas nullus defenderet aut doceret Parisius et ad
sententiam
excommunicationis
et
damnationis
opinionum earundem nullatenus processissent nil
temerarium commisissent.

Master There are some who think that although no
gathering less than a general council nor anyone
inferior to the highest pontiff can licitly
excommunicate or condemn as heretical any assertion
that has not been explicitly condemned, yet other
gatherings and prelates inferior to the pope are
permitted for a reasonable cause to forbid erroneous
assertions and to order that they not be defended
publicly. And therefore they say that if the University
of Paris and the oft-mentioned archbishops of
Canterbury had forbidden Thomas's opinions for a
reasonable cause, only ordering that no one was to
defend or teach them publicly at Paris, and had not
proceeded to a sentence of excommunication and
condemnation of those opinions, they would have
done nothing rash.

Discipulus Quae potest esse causa rationabilis
praecipiendi opiniones aliquas publice non teneri?

Student What can be a reasonable cause for ordering
that some opinions not be held publicly?

Magister Dicunt quod pro scandalo et schismate
aliisque malis et periculis evitandis possunt opiniones
aliquae etiam verae quandoque rationibiliter interdici.

Master They say that any opinions, even sometimes
true ones, can be reasonably forbidden for the purpose
of avoiding scandal, schism and other evils and
dangers.

Discipulus Nunquid fuit unquam aliquod scandalum
de opinionibus Thomae?

Student Was there ever any scandal about Thomas's
opinions?

Magister Saepe audivi a multis Anglicis enarrari quod
de opinione Thomae de unitate formae quando
conclusiones quae sequuntur ex ipsa explicabantur
scandalum fuit in Anglicano populo infinitum.

Master I have often heard it said by many
Englishmen that when conclusions which follow from
Thomas's opinion about the unity of form were
explained there was endless scandal among the
English people.

Discipulus Quae fuerunt illae conclusiones sequentes
ex opinione de unitate formae quae expresse
scandalizabant populum?

Student What were those conclusions following from
that opinion about the unity of form which expressly
scandalised the people?

Magister Secundum istos subscriptae sunt. Quod
corpus Christi non fuit idem numero vivum et

Master According to them, they are those written
below. That Christ's body was not the same in number
