conveniently can. And therefore if the pope were to
order that some individuals be arrested and executed
because they are attempting to oppose him by imputing
heretical wickedness to him, these individuals must be
liberated, since in this case the presumption would be in
favour of the opponents of the pope and not in favour of
the pope.
Quod autem presumendum esset pro impugnantibus Here is how one shows that presumption would be in
papam ostenditur. Quia sicut unusquisque presumitur favour of the papal opponents. Since everyone is

presumendum est quod bene agit illa que agit nisi proved, so must one presume of anyone that the quality
contrarium constiterit per legitima documenta. Et ideo si of their actions is good unless the contrary is established
quis facit illud quod bene fieri potest, presumendum est by legitimate examples. And therefore if someone does

que bene et male fieri possunt, in meliorem partem that he does it well before the contrary is established,

rite et iuste ac veraciter impugnet papam de heretica badly must be interpreted in the better sense. Therefore,
pravitate, presumendum est de quolibet impugnante since it is possible for someone to oppose the pope by
papam de heretica pravitate quod rite et iuste faciat imputing heretical wickedness to him, and to do this
antequam constet contrarium. Pro impugnantibus ergo properly and justly and truthfully, it must be presumed of
papam de heretica pravitate presumendum est, antequam anyone who opposes the pope with an imputation of
legitimis documentis constiterit quod malitiose heretical wickedness that he is doing this properly and

justly, before the contrary shall have been established.
Therefore there must be a presumption in favour of those
who oppose the pope with an imputation of heretical
wickedness before it shall have been established by
legitimate examples that their opposition is malicious
and criminal.
Quod autem non sit presumendum pro papa qui ante And here is how one proves that presumption must not

presumption would have to be against him and not in his
favour.
