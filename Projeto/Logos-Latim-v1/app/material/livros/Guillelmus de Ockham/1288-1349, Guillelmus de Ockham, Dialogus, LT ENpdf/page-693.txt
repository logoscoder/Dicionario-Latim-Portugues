imperatori committit. In gremio enim fidelis
ecclesiae ambo gladii sunt reconditi. Unde
quisquis ibidem non fuerit neutrum habet. Quod
probatur per hoc quod Dominus non dicit {*dixit
&MdMzNaRe} Petro, `Abiice {abiicere &Md}
gladium' sed {*dixit add. &MzNaRe}, `Converte
gladium {*tuum add. &MzNaReVg} in

per {om. &Md} imperatorem potestatem gladii
communicet {exercet &Na} {*exerceret

Potestas enim gladii materialis apud ecclesiam
est implicita sed per imperatorem qui eam {eum

pontifex quando coronat Caesarem exhibet sibi
gladium in vagina contentum. Quem acceptum

hidden as it were in its sheath and
bestows it on the emperor to use it. For
both swords are hidden in the breast of
the faithful church. Whoever, therefore, is
not in that place has neither [sword]. This
is proved by the fact that the Lord did not
say to Peter, `Throw away your sword',
but said [cf. Mat.26:52 and John 18:11],
`Put your sword back into its sheath', so
that Peter would employ, that is, the
power of the sword not himself but
through the emperor. For the power of the
material sword is attached to the church
but is deployed by the emperor who
receives it. As a sign of this, when the
highest pontiff crowns a Caesar he shows
him the sword held in its sheath. When he
has received it the prince takes it out and
indicates by flourishing it that he has
accepted the exercise of it.

Magister Ista {illa &Mz} ratio a nonnullis qui
eam haereticalem reputant [[margin Md]]
multipliciter improbatur {*reprobatur
&MdMzNaPeRe}.

Master That argument is condemned in
many ways by some people, who regard it
as heretical.

Discipulus Quia illa {*Quia illa: Quare ista
opinio hereticalis putatur /reputatur &MdMzPe\
inferius dices cum recitabis quare
&MdMzNaPeRe} opinio quam modo {non &Pz}
tractamus haereticalis aestimatur. Ideo breviter
narra quomodo illa {*ista &MzNaRe} ratio
{*responsio &NaRe} improbatur {*reprobatur
&NaRe}.

Student Why that opinion is thought to
be heretical you will explain below when
you recite why the opinion we are now
treating is considered heretical. So set
down briefly now how that reply is
condemned.

Magister Improbatur primo sic. Rex Franciae et
alii reges quamplures non recipiunt gladii
potestatem a Papa; {*ymo add. &MzPeRe}
etiam quando regnare incipiunt ipsam de nullo

potestate concedenda ipsis. Ergo nec imperator

Master It is attacked first as follows. The
king of France and very many other kings
do not receive the power of the sword
from the pope. Indeed even when they
begin to rule they do not need it from
anyone, either for their coronation or for
