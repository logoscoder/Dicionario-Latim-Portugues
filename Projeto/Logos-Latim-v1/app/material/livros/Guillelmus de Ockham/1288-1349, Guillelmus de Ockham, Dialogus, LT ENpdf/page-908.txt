{revertetur &Mz} ad Romanos?
Magister Ideo {*Hoc &NaRe} dicitur quia
{quod &Re} postquam post mortem papae vel
etiam post infectionem papae haeretica
pravitate eligendus {*electus &NaMzPeRe}
esset papa catholicus, qui etiam {*qui etiam
om. &NaMzPeRe} {*ille papa catholicus add.
&NaPeRe} [[margin Pe]] haberet potestatem
ordinandi de electoribus {*trs.231 &NaRe}
sicut et alii praedecessores {praecessores
&Mz} sui posito quod {*posito quod: si
&NaMzPeRe} Romani transtulerint
{*transtulerunt &NaPeRe} ius et potestatem
suam in papam ratione officii et non ratione
personae {Christi add. &Pe}.

Master This is said because after, on the
death of a pope or also his infection with
heretical wickedness, a catholic pope should
be elected [accepting eligendus]. That
catholic pope would have the same power to
make arrangements about electors as his
other predecessors, if the Romans transferred
that right and power of theirs to the pope by
reason of his office and not by reason of his
person.

Discipulus Quare dicit ista {*illa &MzPe}
opinio quod in isto {*illo &NaPeRe} {nullo
&Mz} casu reverteretur {revertitur &Na}
{revertetur &Mz} {*ad Romanos add.
&NaRe} non solum ius eligendi sed etiam {et
&Mz} potestas ordinandi de electoribus?

Student Why does that opinion say that in
that case not only does the right of choosing
revert to the Romans but also the power of
making arrangements about electors?

Magister Hoc dicitur quia {quod &Mz} saepe
aliqua multitudo habet ius eligendi et tamen
non expedit quod omnes eligant quia multi
moverentur malo zelo et saepe non possent in
personam idoneam convenire, aliquotiens
{aliquoties &Na} etiam non possent in unum
locum congruum {*congrue &NaPeRe}
convenire, et ideo expedit quod ordinent qui
{quid &Mz} debeant eligere committendo uni
personae vel personis paucis respectu totius
multitudinis distinctis {*discretis &NaRe}
{discrete &Pe} et zelum fidei ac boni
communis habentibus {eorum add. &Pe} ius
eligendi. Propter hoc enim ab antiquo
electiones praelatorum concessae fuerunt
clericis, quia, licet omnes clerici et laici
habuerunt {habuerint &Pe} ius eligendi, de
consensu tamen laicorum, propter hoc quod
clerici erant sapientiores et sanctiores
{scientiores &Na} laicis, ordinatum fuit quod
ipsi soli haberent ius eligendi. Et ideo quando
laici essent discretiores et meliores clericis ius
eligendi deberet auferri a clericis et dari laicis

Master This is said because some multitude
often has the right to elect without its being
expedient that everyone elect, because many
would be inspired by an evil zeal and often
they could not agree on a suitable person, at
different times they could not even agree
suitably on one place, and therefore it is
expedient that they make arrangements about
who should elect by committing the right to
elect to one person or to a few persons
separate from the whole multitude and having
a zeal for the faith and the common good. For
it was on account of this that the elections of
prelates were conceded from of old to clerics,
because, although all clerics and laymen had
the right to elect, yet it was arranged with the
agreement of laymen, because of the fact that
clerics were wiser and holier than laymen,
that they alone [the clerics] were to have the
right to elect. And therefore when laymen
were wiser and better than clerics the right to
elect should have been removed from clerics
and given to laymen, because those things
