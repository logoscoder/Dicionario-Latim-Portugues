glossam errare quia textum aperte corrumpit, cum textus
affirmet omnes apostolos cum beato Petro pares in
potestate fuisse; administracio autem est potestas
quedam vel actus potestatis. Ergo Petrus in
administracione alios apostolos nullatenus precellebat.

that the gloss is wrong here because it clearly
falsifies the text, since the text affirms that all the
apostles were equal in power to blessed Peter.
Administration, however, is a certain power or an
act of power. Therefore Peter was not superior to the
other apostles in administration.

Item predictam assercionem, quod beatus Petrus alios
apostolos minime precellebat, probant auctoritate
Cypriani qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Loquitur, ait,
"Loquitur Dominus ad Petrum, 'Ego tibi dico quia tu es
Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam.'
Super unum edificat ecclesiam et quamvis apostolis
omnibus post resurreccionem suam parem potestatem
tribuat et dicat, 'Sicut misit me pater, et ego mitto vos.
Accipite Spiritum sanctum', tamen ut unitatem
manifestaret unitatis eiusdem originem ab uno
incipientem sua auctoritate disposuit. Hoc erant utique
ceteri apostoli quod Petrus fuit pari consorcio prediti
honoris et potestatis." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi
quod licet Petrus prius habuerit potestatem a Christo,
postea tamen apostoli parem potestatem acceperunt, et
ita Petrus ex tunc eos ex ordinatione Christi in potestate
et per consequens nec in administracione nullatenus
precellebat.

Also, they prove the above assertion, that blessed
Peter was not superior to the other apostles, by a text
of Cyprian found at 24, q. 1, c. Loquitur. He says
[col.971], "The Lord says to Peter, 'And I say to
you, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build
my church'. He builds his church on one man, and
although he bestows equal power on all the apostles
after his resurrection, saying to them, 'As the Father
hath sent me, I also send you. ... Receive ye the
Holy Ghost', yet so that he might clearly show its
unity he organised by his own authority the origin of
that unity, which began from one man. In this way
the rest of the apostles were undoubtedly endowed
in a fellowship of honour and power equal to that of
Peter." We are given to understand by these words
that although Peter had power from Christ first, yet
afterwards the apostles received equal power, and so
from then on Peter was not superior to them by
Christ's ordination in power nor, as a consequence,
in administration.

Item hoc probant auctoritate beati Augustini que ponitur
2, q. 7, c. Paulus. Ait enim, "Paulus Petrum reprehendit,
quod non auderet nisi se non imparem sciret."

Also, they prove this by the text of blessed
Augustine found at 2, q. 7, c. Paulus. For he says
[col.493], "Paul censured Peter, which he would not
have dared to do if he had not known that he was his
equal."

Discipulus Ad hoc respondet glossa ibidem dicens quod
scivit se non imparem "meritis non tamen
administracione."

Student: The gloss at that point [s. v. imparem;
col.698] replies to this when it says that he knew
that he was equal "in merit but not in
administration."

Magister Hanc responsionem putant falsam et frivolam.
Falsa enim est, ut dicunt, quia licet Paulus se in charitate
esse scivisset et multa merita habuisse, non tamen scivit
se esse parem beato Petro in meritis; ymmo probabile est
quod tanquam vere humilis reputaverit beatum Petrum se
precellere sanctitate, nec aliquo modo, nisi per
revelacionem, potuit scire se non imparem meritis beato
Petro. Non autem legitur quod Deus revelaverit beato
Paulo quod meritis fuerit par beato Petro. Ergo
temerarium est dicere quod beatus Paulus scivit se parem
beato Petro quia quod de scripturis autenticis non
profertur temerarie affirmatur. Est eciam frivola quia ad
hoc quod aliquis reprehendat alium non requiritur paritas
meritorum, tunc enim numquam minus bonus posset
reprehendere meliorem. Intelligit ergo Augustinus quod
Paulus par fuit beato Petro potestate et quod ei non erat
subiectus nec in administracione nec in aliis
quibuscumque que ad superioritatem et potestatem

Master: They think that this reply is false and
frivolous. For it is false, they say, because although
Paul would have known that he was in charity and
had many merits yet he did not know that he was
equal to blessed Peter in merit; in fact it is probable
that, being truly humble, he regarded blessed Peter
as surpassing him in sanctity -- and he could not
have known in any way except by revelation that he
was equal in merit to blessed Peter. We do not read,
however, that God revealed to blessed Paul that he
was equal in merit to blessed Peter. It is rash to say,
therefore, that Paul knew he was equal in merit to
blessed Peter because what is not cited from
authentic scriptures is rashly affirmed. It is also
frivolous because equality of merit is not required in
order for someone to censure another for then a less
good person could never censure a better one.
Therefore Augustine means that Paul was equal to
