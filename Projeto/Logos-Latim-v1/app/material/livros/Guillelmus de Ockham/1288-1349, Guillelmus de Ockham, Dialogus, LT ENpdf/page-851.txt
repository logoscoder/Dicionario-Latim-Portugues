give them to his courtiers." We gather from
these words and almost all those found in
the text that was cited that it pertains to a
king's right to be able to take everything for
the private benefit of the king.

Magister Respondetur quod utilitas regis est
communis utilitas. Unde, sicut qui peccat in

{omnes subiectos: omnibus subiectis &Pe} sibi
{*trs. &MzNaRe}, sic qui aliquid facit regi hoc
videtur quodammodo facere {*trs. &MzNaRe}

quando rex propria negocia non posset expedire

Master The reply is that the king's benefit
is the common benefit. Hence, just as he
who sins against a king sins to some extent
against everyone subject to him, so he who
does something for a king seems to some
extent to do this for all those subject to him.
And therefore when a king was not able to
expedite his own affairs by using his own
slaves and his own things, he was able, in
order to expedite his own affairs, to take
away the things, slaves and sons of others
subject to him and in this he assisted the
common benefit. And it was in this way
that God said that all those things pertained
to the king's right. When there was no such
necessity, however, he could not do the
above things, and therefore, as we read in 3
Kings 21:1-4, Naboth the Jezreelite refused
to give, exchange or sell his vineyard to
King Ahab because he saw that the king
was not seeking it out of any necessity or
for the common good but only out of
avarice and greed. Hence too, as we read in
3 Kings 12:4, the whole multitude of Israel
said to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon,
"Your father made our yoke heavy",
implying that he had oppressed them
against justice and the legitimate power of
a king. Therefore, although a king can take
away the things, servants and sons of his
subjects and apply them to his own benefit,
when his own resources are not sufficient
and the common benefit would be hindered
if the king's own affairs were not expedited,
nevertheless he can not do this when it
would not redound to the common benefit.
