Parisiensi multipliciter respondetur. Uno modo quod
multas assertiones temerarie condemnavit, veritates
scilicet condemnando. Nullo enim modo potest
solenniter veritas absque temeritate damnari. Licet
namque absque temeritate damnabili valeat quis
veritati contrarium opinari et de veritate dubitare,
nunquam tamen veritas solenniter et publice absque
damnabili temeritate damnatur. Cum igitur multorum
iudicio inter articulos damnatos Parisius contineantur
veritates quamplures, sequitur quod eadem universitas
plures assertiones temerarie condemnavit. Istius
sententiae fuerunt et sunt omnes illi qui extra
Universitatem Parisiensem opiniones damnatas
Parisius tenuerunt et tenent. Eiusdem etiam sententiae
sunt omnes illi qui post revocationem praedictae
sententiae quantum ad opiniones Thomae easdem
opiniones Thomae prius damnatas nunc Parisius tenent
et approbant publice vel occulte.

Paris, many replies are made. One way is that it has
condemned many assertions rashly, that is, by
condemning truths. For in no way can the truth be
solemnly condemned without rashness. For although
anyone can without culpable rashness offer an opinion
which is opposed to a truth and can doubt its truth, yet
a truth is never solemnly and publicly condemned
without culpable rashness. Therefore since very many
truth are, according to the judgement of many,
contained among the articles condemned at Paris, it
follows that that university condemned many
assertions rashly. Of that opinion have been and are
all those outside the University of Paris who have held
and hold the opinions condemned at Paris. Also of
that way of thinking are all those who, since the
revocation of the aforesaid sentence in respect of
Thomas's opinions, now publicly or secretly maintain
and approve at Paris those same opinions of his that
were earlier condemned.

Discipulus Miror quod dicis aliquos ante revocationem
sententiae Parisiensis assertiones damnatas Parisius
tenuisse, nisi forsitan ignoranter nescientes assertiones
fuisse damnatas ibidem.

Student I wonder at your saying that before the
revocation of that sentence of Paris some people had
maintained the assertions condemned at Paris, unless
perhaps in their ignorance they did not know that the
assertions had been condemned there.

Magister Volo te scire quod multi scienter nonnullas
assertiones damnatas Parisius occulte et publice
docuerunt. Unde et per certitudinem scio quendam
doctorem de Ordine Praedicatorum assertionem
damnatam Parisius publice ante praedictam
revocationem determinasse, et cum contra se ipsum
obiceret quod dicta assertio quam tenuit erat
excommunicata
Parisius
respondit
illam
excommunicationem nequaquam mare transisse. Istius
etiam sententiae Magister Godfridus de Fontibus fuisse
videtur, determinans et in scriptis relinquens quod
articuli damnati erant corrigendi.

Master I want you to know that many people have
knowingly taught secretly and publicly a number of
assertions condemned at Paris. Whence I know as a
certainty that a certain doctor of the Order of
Preachers had publicly taught an assertion condemned
at Paris before the above-mentioned revocation, and
when he made the objection against himself that the
assertion which he maintained had been
excommunicated at Paris he replied that the said
excommunication had not crossed the sea. Master
Godfrey of Fontaines seems to have been of that
opinion too, teaching and leaving it in his writings that
the condemned articles should have been corrected.

Capitulum 22

Chapter 22

Discipulus Verba quae refers cogunt me incidentaliter
interrogare, si aliquae veritates cum assertoribus
earundem fuerunt Parisius excommunicatae, an
tenentes
Parisius
veritates
easdem
in
excommunicationis sententiam inciderunt cum
sententia lata ex causa iniqua neminem involvere
videatur.

Student The words which you report force me to ask
you incidentally whether, if some truths together with
those affirming them were excommunicated at Paris,
those maintaining those truths at Paris fell under a
sentence of excommunication, since a sentence
imposed for an unfair reason is seen not to involve
anyone.

Magister Nonnulli putant quod si dicta sententia
excommunicationis aliquae assertiones catholicae
excommunicatae fuerunt, ipsa nullum tenentem
veritatem damnatam de facto potuit quoquomodo
ligare, nec talis debuit se reputare ligatum, licet alii
credentes dictam sententiam non esse iniquam ipsum
tanquam excommunicatum vitare debuerunt.

Master Some people think that if some catholic
assertions were excommunicated by the said sentence
of excommunication, it could in fact in no way have
bound anyone holding the condemned truth, nor
should such a person have regarded himself as bound,
although others who believe that the said sentence was
not unfair should have avoided him as an
