pope or someone else is a heretic, if he is ready to be
corrected he is not to be deposed (as in 24 q. 3 c. Dixit
Apostolus)[col. 998]. Or at least they should not have
deposed him since he had been acting under duress."
From these words we understand that bishops have the
power of deposing a pope accused of heresy, although
they should not always depose him because sometimes
he does not deserve to be deposed. But it is their
function to hear the case of the pope and accordingly
they hold power over him.
