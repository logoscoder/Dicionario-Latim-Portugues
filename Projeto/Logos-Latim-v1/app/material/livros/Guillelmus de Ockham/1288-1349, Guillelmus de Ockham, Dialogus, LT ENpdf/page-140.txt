ignorant, sufficit quod iurent se ignorare. Et sic a
pravitate haeretica per ignorantiam excusantur.

nonetheless, claim ignorance now by saying that they
do not know that such heresies have been condemned;
and if proof of their ignorance is sought from them, it
is enough for them to swear that they do not know;
and in this way they are excused of heretical
wickedness by ignorance.

Capitulum 22

Chapter 22

Discipulus Adhuc de ista materia unam difficultatem
discutias? an videlicet sciens aliquam haeresim esse
damnatam, quam putat esse ambiguam, duos sensus
habentem, si teneat eam sub senso damnato, quem non
putat esse damnatum, valeat de pravitate haeretica per
ignorantiam excusari?

Disciple Would you discuss one further difficulty
about this matter? Whether, that is, someone who
knows some heresy has been condemned which he
thinks is ambiguous and has two significations can be
excused of heretical wickedness through ignorance if
he holds it in the condemned signification but does not
think that it is condemned?

Magister Ad hoc respondetur quod si sciens haeresim
esse damnatam non tenetur scire sub quo sensu est
damnata, licet tenuerit sensum damnatum, non est
statim haereticus iudicandus. Si autem tenetur scire
sub quo sensu est damnata, non potest per ignorantiam
excusari.

Master It is replied to this that if someone who knows
a heresy has been condemned is not bound to know
what signification of it has been condemned, he should
not be judged immediately to be a heretic even if he
holds to the condemned signification. If he is bound to
know what signification of it has been condemned,
however, he can not be excused through ignorance.

Primum sic probatur. Damnata aliqua assertione,
nullus per illam damnationem astringitur ad negandum
aliam assertionem quae ex sola assertione damnata
inferri non potest. Sed ex assertione ambigua diversos
sensus habente sensus determinatus inferri non potest.
Ergo, damnata assertione ambigua, non astringitur quis
negare determinatum sensum quia potest probabiliter
dubitare in quo sensu sit damnata. Ergo si quis ex
ignorantia absque omni pertinacia tenet haeresim
ambiguam condemnatam in illo sensu in quo
secundum intentionem damnantium est damnata, si
illum sensum minime expresserunt, non est statim
pertinax et haereticus iudicandus; sed antea est sibi
ostendendum aperte quod non solum assertio ambigua
est damnata sed etiam quod talis sensus determinatus
veritati obviat orthodoxae.

The first is proved as follows. When some assertion
has been condemned, no one is obliged by that
condemnation to deny another assertion unless it can
be inferred solely from that condemned assertion; but
from an ambiguous assertion which has several
significations a fixed signification can not be inferred.
If an ambiguous assertion has been condemned,
therefore, no one is obliged to deny any fixed
signification because he can with probability doubt
what signification of it has been condemned. If anyone
out of ignorance and without any pertinacity,
therefore, holds an ambiguous condemned heresy in
that signification which its condemners intended to
condemn, he should not be judged immediately to be
pertinacious and a heretic, if they have not described
that signification; but it should first be clearly shown
to him not only that the ambiguous assertion has been
condemned but also that with its signification defined
in that way it conflicts with orthodox truth.

Discipulus Isti videntur errare cum dicunt assertionem
ambiguam esse damnatam, cum assertio ambigua
damnari non debeat, praesertim si habeat aliquem
sensum catholicum.

Disciple They seem to err when they say "an
ambiguous assertion has been condemned" because an
ambiguous assertion ought not be condemned,
especially if it has some catholic signification.

Magister Respondetur tibi quod tu erras aperte. Nam
nonnunquam assertio ambigua habens aliquem sensum
catholicum est damnata. Unde et aliquando assertiones
contradictoriae secundum vocem sunt damnatae; ex
quo tamen contradictoriae sunt secundum vocem,
altera illarum vel utraque habet sensum verum.

Master You are answered that it is you who plainly
err. For sometimes an ambiguous assertion with some
catholic sense has been condemned. Indeed sometimes
even assertions that are literally contradictory have
been condemned; yet because they are literally
contradictory one or other of them has a true
