Ad secundam respondetur per idem, quod qui
est dominus personarum est quodammodo
dominus rerum spectantium ad sibi subiectos
vel ad {*sibi subiectos vel ad om. &NaRe}
personas easdem, et ideo imperator
{*quodamodo add. &MzNaRe} est {trs. &Mz}
dominus omnium rerum spectantium ad sibi
subiectos, {vel ad personas ... subiectos om.
&Pe} quia potest eis uti pro utilitate communi,
non tamen ad libitum suum absque rationabili
causa.

The reply to the second [argument] is the
same, that he who is people's lord is to
some extent the lord of the things
pertaining to those people, and therefore
the emperor is to a certain extent the lord of
all the things pertaining to those subject to
him, because he can use them for the
common benefit, although not at his own
pleasure without some reasonable grounds.

Ad tertiam dicitur {*repondetur &NaRe} {om.
&MzPe} quod omnia sunt in potestate
imperatoris quia omnia potest {imperator add.
&Na} accipere sibi, pro utilitate communi non
tamen ad libitum suum {*non tamen ad libitum
suum: et non aliter &MzNaPeRe}. Et ideo est
dominus isto {*illo &MzNaPeRe} modo quo
dictum est prius {*et add. &MzNaPeRe} non
aliter.

The reply to the third is that everything is in
the power of the emperor because he can
take everything to himself, for the common
benefit and not otherwise. And he is lord in
that way which was described before,
therefore, and not in other respects.

Ad quartam {quartum &Mz} respondetur quod
rex est quodammodo dominus omnium {om.
&Re} {*illorum add. &MzNaPeRe} quae {qui
&MzPe} sunt in regno suo, non tamen sic quod
{*ut &MzNaPeRe} ad libitum {*suum add.
&MzNaRe} possit de eis quod {quid &Re}
voluerit ordinare, sed quia potest omnia tollere
pro bono communi, et isto modo praedixit Deus
quod omnia quae erant filiorum {filiis &Pe}
Israel debebant spectare ad ius regis.

The reply to the fourth is that a king is to a
certain extent the lord of all those things
which are in his kingdom, yet not in such a
way that he can at his pleasure make any
arrangements he wants for them, but
because he can remove everything for the
common good. And it was in that way that
God announced that everything that
belonged to the children of Israel ought to
pertain to the right of the king.

Discipulus Videtur quod non solum spectat
{*spectabant &MzNaPeRe} ad illud {*om.
&MzNaPeRe} ius regis {*posse add. &NaRe}
accipere quae erant subditorum suorum pro
utilitate communi sed {*etiam add. &NaRe}
per {*pro &MzNaPeRe} utilitate propria
scilicet {*om. &NaRe} regis, cum in
auctoritate allegata ibidem dicatur expresse,
{suorum etiam messores et add. &Mz} "Filios
vestros tollet et ponet in curribus suis ... et
constituet ... aratores agrorum {*suorum add.

Student It seems that it pertains to the right
of a king to be able to take what belongs to
his subjects not only for the common
benefit but also for his own, that is the
king's, benefit, since in the text cited there
it expressly says [1 Kings 8:11, 12, 14],
"He will take your sons and appoint them
to his chariots ... and he will appoint ...
some to plough his ground and to reap his
harvests ... He will take the best of your
fields and vineyards and olive orchards and
