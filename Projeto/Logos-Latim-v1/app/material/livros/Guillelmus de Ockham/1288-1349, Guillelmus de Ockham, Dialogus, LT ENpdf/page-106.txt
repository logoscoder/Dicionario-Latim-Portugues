Magister Ad hoc respondetur faciliter quia de
exterioribus habemus tantummodo iudicare, occulta
autem ad iudicium spectant divinum. Et ideo talis a
nobis est censendus haereticus propter illa quae nobis
apparent exterius licet apud Deum non sit haereticus,
quemadmodum saepe multos bonos arbitrari debemus
quia nullum malum in ipsis nobis apparet qui tamen
apud Deum sunt pessimi.

Master This is easily replied to because we have the
power to judge only about externals, while hidden
matters belong to divine judgement. And therefore
such a person should be considered a heretic by us
because of those things that appear to us externally
even if he is not a heretic in God's eyes, just as we
should often think many men to be good because there
seems to us to be no evil in them who are nevertheless
very evil in God's eyes.

Discipulus Discurre per obiectiones quas feci.

Student Run through the objections that I made.

Magister Ad primam earum respondetur quod qui
veteres haereses pertinaciter imitantur sunt censendi
haeretici. Et ideo non solum illi qui quacunque ex
causa novas ac falsas opiniones gignunt vel sequuntur
sunt haeretici sed etiam alii. Nam qui modo haeresim
Arrii ab antiquo damnatam pertinaciter defensaret esset
haereticus iudicandus. Nec obstant verba Augustini
qui, ut dictum est, non intendit per illa verba neque
diffinitionem neque descriptionem haeretici assignare.
Unde dicunt quod multi saepe falluntur de
enunciationibus sanctorum et auctorum putantes eos
velle diffinitiones vel descriptiones aliquarum rerum
vel nominum assignare cum tamen nonnunquam
intendant solummodo propositiones particulariter veras
asserere.

Master The reply to the first of them is that those who
pertinaciously imitate old heresies should be
considered heretics. And therefore not only those who
generate or follow new and false opinions for any
reason at all are heretics, but also others. For he who
would now defend Arius's heresy, condemned from of
old, should be adjudged a heretic. And Augustine's
words do not oppose this because, as has been said, he
did not intend to ascribe a definition or description of
a heretic by those words. Hence they say that many
people are often misled by the propositions of saints
and writers thinking that they want to give definitions
or descriptions of things or words when sometimes
they only intend to affirm propositions as particularly
true.

Ad secundam respondetur quod pertinaciter errantes ex
sola credulitate vel deceptione sunt haeretici iudicandi
quia non soli illi de quibus loquitur Augustinus in
verbis praemissis sed etiam alii sunt censendi haeretici.

The reply to the second is that those erring
pertinaciously only because of credulity or deception
should be adjudged heretical because not only those of
whom Augustine speaks in the afore-mentioned words
should be considered heretics but also others.

Ad tertiam dicunt quod illi qui in corde non dubitant et
tamen alicuius temporalis commodi gratia vel forte pro
temporali periculo citra mortem vitando assertiones
haereticales sequuntur, quales dicunt esse multos his
diebus, et maxime de ordine Fratrum Minorum qui
opiniones novas de paupertate Christi et apostolorum
ac etiam de animabus damnatorum et sanctorum, quas
in cordibus suis putant haereticas et tamen ipsas
pertinaci animositate defendunt, sequuntur, non sunt in
rei veritate haeretici, et tamen a fidelibus qui non
habent de occultis motibus animae iudicare sunt
haeretici reputandi et tanquam haeretici feriendi. Et si
postea dicerent se dictas haereses in mente minime
tenuisse sed pro assequendo aliquo commodo
temporali vel pro vitando periculo se finxisse tenere,
non esset eis fides aliqua adhibenda sed essent ab omni
assertione et testimonio tanquam falsi et duplices
repellendi.

To the third they say that those who do not doubt in
their heart and yet follow heretical assertions for the
sake of some temporal advantage or perhaps in order
to avoid some temporal danger short of death, (of
whom they say there are many in these days, and
especially from the Order of Friars Minor who follow
new opinions about the poverty of Christ and the
apostles and also about the souls of the damned and of
the saints which in their hearts they think are heretical
and which they nevertheless defend with pertinacious
ill will) are not in truth of fact heretics, and yet they
should be regarded as heretics by believers, who do
not have the power to judge the hidden movements of
the soul, and they should be smitten as heretics. And if
they were to say afterwards that they had not held the
said heresies in their mind but had feigned to hold
them in order to obtain some temporal advantage or to
avoid some danger, no trust should be offered to them
but they should be repulsed as false and duplicitous
from [giving] any assertion in testimony.
