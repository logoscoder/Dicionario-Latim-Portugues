CAP. XXVI {XXV &PE}

Discipulus Quaesivimus de aliquibus in
speciali quam super {in &Pe} ipsa {ipsas &Re}
{ipsis &Mz} imperator habeat potestatem.
Nunc quaero in generali an in temporalibus
imperator {*trs.312 &MzNaPeRe} habeat
plenitudinem potestatis, quemadmodum
secundum multos papa in spiritualibus
potestatis plenitudinem {*trs. &MzNaPeRe}
habere dignoscitur.

CHAPTER 26

Student About some things in particular
we have asked what power the emperor has
over them. Now I seek to find out in
general whether the emperor has fullness of
power in temporal matters, as the pope is
known to have, according to some people,
fullness of power in spiritual matters.

DOES THE EMPEROR HAVE FULLNESS OF POWER IN TEMPORAL THINGS?

Magister Circa hoc sunt assertiones diversae.
Una est quod imperator in temporalibus sic
{*trs.312 &NaRe} habet plenitudinem
potestatis quod omnia potest quae non sunt
contra ius divinum vel {*nec &MzNaRe}
contra {om. &Pe} ius naturale ita quod in
omnibus huiusmodi tenentur sibi obedire
omnes sui {*sibi &MzNaPeRe} subiecti.

Master There are different assertions about
this. One is that the emperor has such
fullness of power in temporal matters that
he can do everything which is not against
divine law or against natural law, with the
result that all those subject to him are
bound to obey him in all matters of this
kind.

10.60.1 Opinion 1: The emperor has power to do anything not contrary to divine or natural law, and in such
matters all his subjects must obey him

Discipulus Pro ista opinione {*assertione
&NaRe} {allegatione &Mz} allegare nitere
{*trs. &MzNaRe}.

Student Would you try to argue for that
assertion?

Magister Pro ista opinione {*assertione
&NaRe} potest multipliciter allegari. Qui enim
nulla lege humana astringitur sed solummodo
lege divina et lege naturali {*lege .. naturali: ad
leges divinas et leges naturales &MzNaPeRe}
obligatur omnia potest quae non sunt contra
aliquam legum {legem &MzPe} praedictarum.
Sed imperator nulla lege humana astringitur sed
legibus divinis et naturalibus quia, sicut habetur
ff. de legibus et glossa recitat Extra, De

Master Many arguments can be brought
forward for that opinion. For he who is
bound by no human law but is under an
obligation only to divine laws and natural
laws can do anything which is not against
any of the above laws. But the emperor is
bound by no human law, but by divine and
natural laws because, as we find in ff. de
legibus and as the gloss on Extra, De
constitutionibus, c. Canonum [col.15]
