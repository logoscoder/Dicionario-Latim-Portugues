Magister Quod imperator possit et debeat
papam pro omni crimine iudicare
quampluribus viis ostenditur, quarum una,
quae etiam {*tacta add. &NaRe} {tanta add.
&Mz} est in prima parte tacta {*om.
&MzNaRe} istius Dialogi, sumitur ex unitate
summi {*supremi &NaRe} iudicis {*trs.
&MzNaRe} quam {quem &NaRe} omnis
communitas bene ordinata habere debet {*trs.
&NaRe}. Nam omne regnum, omnis civitas,
omne collegium et omnis communitas debet
habere unum solum iudicem simpliciter
supremum vel plures summos {*supremos
&NaRe} idem officium habentes {*trs.
&MzNaRe} seu gerentes vicem unius a {om.
&Mz} quo vel a {*om. &MzNaRe} quibus
omnes alii debent iudicari. Ergo tota
universitas mortalium, si fuerit bene ordinata et
{vel &Na} gubernata, habet {*habebit
&MzNaRe} unum simpliciter summum
{*supremum &NaRe} iudicem vel plures
habentes idem officium {*seu gerentes vicem
unius add. &NaRe} a quo vel quibus omnes
alii debent {*debeant &NaRe} iudicari.
Religio autem Christiana non impedit aut
{*nec &MzNaRe} destruit {*trs.321 &NaRe}
bonam dispositionem communitatis mortalium.
Ergo nihil invenitur in ea repugnans optimae
dispositioni universitatis mortalium, {*sed
quicquid invenitur in ipsa est conveniens
optimae dispositioni mortalium add. &NaRe}.
Ex quo concluditur quod in nullo obviat
religioni christianae quia quicquid invenitur in
ea est conveniens optimae dispositioni {*quia
quicquid ... dispositioni om. &NaRe}
{*universitatem add. &NaRe} mortalium et
per consequens {*et per consequens om.
&NaRe} unum habere summum {*supremum
&NaRe} iudicem vel plures idem habentes
officium {*seu add. &MzNaRe} tenentes
locum {*vicem &NaRe} unius a quo vel a
{*om. &NaRe} quibus alii omnes {*trs.
&MzNaRe} pro omni crimine debeant iudicari
non repugnat religioni Christianae {*non
repugnat religioni Christianae om. &NaRe}.
Sed iste {*ille unus &NaRe} summus

Master [1] That the emperor can and ought
to judge the pope for any crime is shown in
very many ways, one of which, cited also in
the first part of this Dialogue, is taken from
the singleness of the supreme judge which
every well ordered community should have.
For every kingdom, every city, every college
and every community should have one single
judge who is plainly supreme, or many who
are supreme and hold or manage the same
office in place of that one, and all others
should be judged by this one or by these. If
the whole totality of mortals, therefore, is
well ordered and governed it will have one
plainly supreme judge, or many holding the
same office or acting in place of one, and by
this one or these all the others should be
judged. The christian religion, however, does
not destroy or prevent the good management
of the community of mortals. Nothing is
found in it, therefore, which is contrary to the
best management of the totality of mortals,
but whatever is found in it is consistent with
the best management of the totality of
mortals. We conclude from this that it does
not conflict with the christian religion that the
totality of mortals have one supreme judge,
or many holding or maintaining the same
office in place of that one, and that all others
should be judged for any crime by that one or
by those. But that one supreme judge is not
the pope and the pope can not even hold such
an office. The pope himself, therefore, should
be judged by that supreme one. That supreme
judge, however, is the emperor who is by
right the prince and lord of the whole world.
Therefore the emperor has the right to judge
the pope for any crime.
