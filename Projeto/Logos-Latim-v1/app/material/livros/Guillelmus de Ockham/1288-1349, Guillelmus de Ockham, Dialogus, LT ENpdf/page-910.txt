Magister Respondetur quod in tali casu
provinciae vel dioeceses aut {*parochie vel

/om. NaRe\ valerent deberent eligere aliquas
personas et eis committere vices suas que
nomine absentium cum aliis de electione
tractare deberent. Quecumque autem provincie

et quaecunque personae diligentiam quam
deberent minime adhibentes {*adhiberent
&NaMzPeRe} ad eligendum summum

potestate de electione facienda ordinandi
{*trs.4123 &NaRe} privatae, {privati
&NaMzPeRe} et ius eligendi {ordinandi &Pe}
devolveretur ad alios, ita quod {ita quod:
itaque &Re} si unus solus clericus vel laicus
remaneret qui ut deberet esset {esse &NaRe}
solicitus de electione facienda ius eligendi
devolveretur ad ipsum. [[ita quod ... ad ipsum
is written twice in Re; the first time, which is
crossed out, reads ita quod for itaque, esset for
esse and alios for ipsum.]].

Master The reply is that in such a case the
provinces, dioceses, parishes or any other
large groups which can not come together
ought to elect some persons and commit their
duties to them, who in the name of those who
are absent ought with others to manage the
election. Whatever provinces, dioceses or
large groups, however, and whatever persons
were not to employ the care which they owe
in choosing the highest pontiff, would for that
reason be deprived of the right to elect and of
the power to make arrangements for the
holding of the election, and the right to elect
would devolve upon others, so that if only
one cleric or layman were to remain who was
solicitous as he should be about making the
election, the right to elect would devolve
upon him.

Discipulus Quid si nullus esset sollicitus ut
deberet?

Student What if no one were solicitous as he
should be?

Magister Respondetur quod, sicut nunquam
usque ad finem mundi fides deficiet, ita
semper aliquis erit in gratia et debito modo
sollicitus de his quae sunt necessaria Dei
ecclesiae {*trs. Re} {Dei ecclesiae: in ecclesia
Dei Na}. Si autem nullus esset sollicitus sed
omnes essent {*om. &NaPeRe} negligentes
circa electionem summi pontificis necessario
faciendam omnes essent extra gratiam et in
peccato mortali quod nunquam {deo
concedente add. &Pe} eveniet {evenient &Re}
{in hoc mundo add. &Pe}.

Master The reply is that just as until the end
of the world faith will never be lacking, so
there will always be someone in grace and
duly solicitous for those things which are
necessary for the church of God. If no one
were solicitous, however, but all were
careless about the necessary election that had
to be made of a supreme pontiff, all would be
outside grace and in mortal sin, but this will
never happen.
