CAPITULUM 29.

Chapter 29.

Discipulus Satis audivi de isto modo errantem de Student I have heard enough about that way of
pertinacia convincendi et ideo alium modum expone.
convicting of pertinacity someone erring, and so
explain another way.

Magister Duodecimo est quis de pertinacia
convincendus si errans contra fidem catholicam
correctioni et emendationi illius vel illorum cuius vel
quorum interest subicere se recusat. Hoc tali ratione
probatur. Ille qui iudicium subterfugit pro nocente debet
haberi, teste Bonifacio papa, qui, ut habetur Extra, De
praesumptionibus c. Nullus dubitat, ait, "Nullus dubitat
quod ita nocens iudicium subterfugit quemadmodum ut
absolvatur qui est innocens quaerit." Cui concordat
Pelagius papa, qui, ut habetur 11. q. 1. c. Christianis, ait
"Qui iudicium refugit apparet eum de iustitia diffisum."
Hoc etiam ex auctoritate Bonifatii papae quae ponitur 3.
q. 9. c. Decernimus et ex verbis Gregorii quae ponuntur
dist. 74. c. Honoratus colligitur evidenter. Errans igitur
contra fidem qui iudicium subterfugit pertinax et
haereticus est censendus. Qui autem correctioni et
emendationi illius vel illorum cuius vel quorum interest
subicere se recusat iudicium subterfugit. Ergo pertinax
et haereticus est censendus.

Master Someone should be convicted of pertinacity in
a twelfth way if he errs against the catholic faith and
refuses to submit himself to correction and amendment
by that person or persons whose concern it is. This is
proved by the following argument. A person who
evades judgement ought to be held to be culpable,
according to the testimony of Pope Boniface who says,
as we find in Extra De presumptionibus, c.[4] Nullus
dubitat, "No one doubts that he who is culpable evades
judgement, just as he who is innocent seeks it in order
to be absolved." [cols.786-7] Pope Pelagius agrees with
this when he says, as we find in 11, q. 1, [c.12]
Christianis, "It is clear that he who flees judgement has
no confidence in his uprightness." [col.903] This is
clearly gathered also from the text of Pope Boniface,
found in 3, q. 9, c.[10] Decernimus, and from the
words of Gregory, found in dist. 74, c. Honoratus.
[cols.358-9] Anyone erring against the faith who
evades judgement, therefore, should be considered
pertinacious and heretical; anyone who refuses to
submit himself to the correction and amendment of the
person or persons whose concern it is evades
judgement; he should be considered, therefore,
pertinacious and heretical.

Discipulus Ista ratio videtur procedere de vocato ad Student That argument seems to be effective for one
iudicium et se per contumaciam absentante; de aliis called to court and absenting himself out of contumacy;
nihil probare videtur.
it seems to prove nothing about others.

Magister Non solum de vocato ad iudicium se per
contumaciam absentante sed etiam de impediente ne
fiat iudicium, ut dicunt isti, concludit ratio supra dicta,
quia sicut ille non est immunis a crimine qui iustitiam
fieri nititur impedire, quamvis ad iudicium minime sit
vocatus, ut habetur Extra, De officio et potestate iudicis
delegati, c. 1 , ita errans contra fidem et ne de errore
suo fiat iudicium impediens non potest a crimine
excusari. Sed istud crimen non videtur aliud quam
pertinacia. Ergo talis est merito pertinax iudicandus.

Master They say that the above argument is conclusive
for someone hindering the making of a judgement, not
only for someone called to court and absenting himself
out of contumacy. For just as that person who tries to
prevent justice being done is not free from reproach
even if he has not been called to court, as we find in
Extra, De officio et potestate iudicis delegati, c. 1 [quia
quaesitum], [col.327] so one who errs against the faith
and hinders the passing of judgement on his error can
not be excused from reproach. But that reproach seems
to be for nothing but pertinacity. Such a person,
therefore, should be deservedly judged to be
pertinacious.

Item errans contra fidem qui non est paratus corrigi nec Again, someone erring against the faith who is not
quaerit cauta sollicitudine veritatem est pertinax et ready to be corrected and does not seek the truth with
haereticus iudicandus, ut ex verbis Augustini quae cautious responsibility should be judged to be
