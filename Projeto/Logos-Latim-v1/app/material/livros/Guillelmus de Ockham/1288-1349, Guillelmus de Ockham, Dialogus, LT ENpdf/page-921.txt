truth and those ten were to become heretics,
the twenty returning to the faith would by the
special decree of Christ recover the right to
elect the supreme pontiff which they had
earlier lost through heretical wickedness.

Discipulus Ubi ordinavit Christus ista?

Student Where did Christ decree these
things?

Magister Dicitur quod Christus specialiter ista
{*om. &NaRe} ordinavit et providit
{*promisit &NaPeRe} {*ista add. &NaRe}
ecclesiae quando specialiter dixit {dicit &Pe}
Mat. ult. "Vobiscum sum omnibus diebus
usque ad consummationem seculi." Tunc
{*enim add. &PeRe} promisit quod nusquam
{*numquam &MzPeRe} usque ad
consummationem seculi {tunc promisit ...
seculi om. &Na} in necessariis {non add.
&Mz} deficeret ecclesiae suae. Et ideo, quia
habere potestatem eligendi summum
pontificem est necessarium ecclesiae Dei, tunc
insuper {*quod semper &NaPeRe} catholici
vel omnes vel aliqui qualescunque fuissent
antequam {an &Na} {*ante &PeRe} haberent
potestatem {*et ius add. &NaRe} eligendi
summum pontificem ordinavit pariter {*et
promisit add. &NaPeRe}. Quare si essent
solummodo 20 {2 &Pe} catholici, et {*etiam
&NaRe} laici et non Romani, qui ante fuissent
haeretici, illi viginti catholici {etiam laici et
non romani qui ante fuissent heretici illi 20
catholici add. &Na} immediate ex speciali
ordinatione et promissione Christi haberent ius
eligendi summum pontificem quia {qui &Na}
non esset {est &Pe} maior ratio quod unus
illorum 20 {duorum &Pe} [[interlinear]]
haberet ius eligendi quam {plusquam &Pe}
alius et ita {om. &Pe} omnes haberent {*idem
add. &NaPeRe} ius.

Master It is said that Christ regulated and
promised these things to the church when he
specifically said in the last chapter of
Matthew [28:20], "I am with you always until
the end of the age." For at that time he
promised that in anything necessary he would
never until the end of the age fail his church.
And therefore, because to have the power to
elect the supreme pontiff is necessary to the
church of God, he arranged and also
promised at that time that catholics, whether
all of them or some, whatever kind they had
been before, would have the power and right
to elect the supreme pontiff. If there were
only those twenty catholics, therefore, even if
they were laymen and not Romans, who had
been heretics before, those twenty catholics
would have directly by a particular regulation
and promise of Christ the right to elect the
supreme pontiff, because there is no better
reason for one of those twenty to have the
right to elect than for another [to have it], and
so all would have the same right.

Discipulus Ista prioribus repugnare videntur
quia secundum ista cardinales effecti haeretici
possent recuperare ius eligendi summum
pontificem absque nova collatione eiusdem
iuris. Ponatur enim quod cardinales primo

Student That seems to conflict with earlier
points, because according to it cardinals who
had become heretics could recover the right
to elect the supreme pontiff without that right
being conferred anew. For it was posited first
