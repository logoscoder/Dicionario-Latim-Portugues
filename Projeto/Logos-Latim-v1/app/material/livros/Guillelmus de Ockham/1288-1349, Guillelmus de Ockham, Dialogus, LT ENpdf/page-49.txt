Discipulus Licet quaedam retuleris de quibus admiror,
unde et de eis postea interrogationem habebo, tamen
conclusio principalis secundae sententiae videtur mihi
probabilis, et miror quod aliquis tenet quod papa potest
facere novum articulum fidei. Tamen qualiter
respondetur ad c. Extra, De haereticis, Cum Christus
indica mihi.

Student Although you have recounted some things at
which I wonder - and I will as a result question you
about them later - the main conclusion of this second
opinion does nevertheless seem probable to me, and I
wonder that anyone holds that the pope can make a
new article of faith. For all that, indicate to me how
reply is made to the chapter Cum Christus in Extra,
De hereticis [col.779].

Magister Volo te scire quod illa allegatio est
quorundam canonistarum, de quibus nonnulli theologi
scandalizantur quando vident eos de theologicis
difficultatibus se intromittere ultra verba theologorum
quae in scriptis suis inveniunt aliquid ex suo ingenio
proferendo. Quia enim in theologia sunt minime eruditi
ideo auctoritates theologiae quas in suis libris reperiunt
non debent exponere ultra sensum grammaticalem, nec
ex eis debent aliquas conclusiones inferre, nisi
sequantur tam patenter quod quilibet illiteratus utens
ratione possit advertere, quia cum saepe verum
auctoritatum theologiae non habeant intellectum si ex
eis voluerint alias conclusiones inferre facile incident
in errores, quod in istis canonistis qui ex praedicto
capitulo Alexandri 3 Cum Christus volebant inferre
quod papa potest facere novum articulum fidei sine
difficultate potest adverti. Nam ex illo capitulo
credebant posse concludi quod ante illam
constitutionem licebat dicere Christum non esse Deum
et hominem, cum tamen non dicat nec ibi inhibeat
dicere Christum non esse Deum et hominem, sed
inhibet dicere Christum non esse aliquid secundum
quod homo. Cuius causam assignat quia Christus est
verus Deus et verus homo. Istae autem sunt assertiones
distinctae, "Christus est verus Deus et verus homo" et
"Christus est aliquid secundum quod homo", una tamen
sequitur ex alia.

Master I want you to know that that argument is
adduced by certain canonists by whom some
theologians are scandalised when they see them
concern themselves with theological difficulties by
putting forward something on the basis of their own
way of thinking beyond the words of theologians that
they find in their own writings. For because they are
not learned in theology they should as a result not
expound the theological authorities that they find in
their own books in more than a grammatical sense,
nor should they infer any conclusions from them
unless they follow so clearly that any unlearned
person at all using his reason can observe them
because, since they often do not have a true
understanding of theological texts, they will easily fall
into errors if they want to infer other conclusions from
them. This can be observed without difficulty in those
canonists who were wanting to infer from the above
chapter of Alexander III, Cum Christus, that the pope
can make a new article of faith. For they believed that
it can be concluded from that chapter that before
[Alexander's] constitution it was permissible to say
that Christ is not God and man, although he does not
say, nor in that place restrain [anyone] from saying,
that Christ is not God and man, but restrains [anyone]
from saying that Christ is nothing as a man. The
reason he adduces for this is that Christ is true God
and true man. However those assertions, "Christ is
true God and true man" and "Christ is something as a
man", are distinct; yet one follows from the other.

Discipulus Clare video quod praedicti canonistae
dictum capitulum Cum Christus male allegant ad
probandum quod ante tempora Alexandri licebat dicere
Christum non esse Deum et hominem. Sed videtur
quod bene allegaverunt ad probandum papam posse
facere novum articulum fidei, quia quod Christus est
aliquid secundum quod homo ante tempora Alexandri
3 non fuit articulus fidei, imo licebat contrarium
opinari; ipse autem fecit quod esset articulus fidei et
quod non licet dicere contrarium. Ergo ipse fecit
novum articulum fidei.

Student I see clearly that the aforesaid canonists
wrongly adduce the said chapter Cum Christus to
prove that before the time of Alexander it was
permissible to say that Christ is not God and man. But
it seems that they have adduced it correctly to prove
that a pope can make a new article of faith, because
before the time of Alexander III it was not an article
of faith that Christ is something as a man - indeed it
was permissible to hold the opposite - however he
brought it about that it was an article of faith and that
it is not permissible to say the opposite. Therefore he
made a new article of faith.

Magister Ad istam tuam obiectionem respondent
secundae sententiae assertores dicentes quod articulus
fidei accipitur stricte, pro veritate catholica in symbolo
autentico sub propria forma inserta, et sic non loquimur

Master Those who affirm the second opinion reply to
that objection of yours by saying that "article of faith"
is taken strictly, as a catholic truth inserted in the
authentic creed in that exact form, and we are not now
