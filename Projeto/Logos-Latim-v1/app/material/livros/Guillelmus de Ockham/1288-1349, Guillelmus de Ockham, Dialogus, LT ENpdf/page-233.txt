de iure deberet Rome sedem habere?

same way as it would be proper to appoint a highest
pontiff who should by right have his see at Rome?

Magister Respondent quod sufficeret solum summum
pontificem eligere, quia alii tituli Rome preter papatum
possunt variari, augeri et minui. Unde et modo sunt
plures quam fuerint temporibus apostolorum, nec forte
aliquis istorum fuit tempore beati Petri, et ideo si tota
Roma esset aversa a fide sufficeret catholicis eligere
papam Romanum, quemadmodum nunc creatur
patriarcha Anciochenus, nec titulos alios Rome
oporteret aliis clericis assignare, sicut nec modo clerici
titulis qui quondam fuerunt in civitatibus patriarchalibus
deputantur.

Master: They reply that it would be enough to
choose a highest pontiff only because except for the
papacy the other titular churches at Rome can be
varied, increased or reduced. So it is that there are
now more [churches] than there were in the times of
the apostles, and perhaps some of them did not exist
in blessed Peter's day. If the whole of Rome were
turned away from the faith, therefore, it would be
enough for catholics to choose a Roman pope, just as
a patriarch of Antioch is now appointed, and it would
not be proper to assign the other titular churches of
Rome to other clerics, just as clerics are not allotted
now to the churches which once existed in those
cities with patriarchs.

Concedunt igitur isti quod verba Pelagii continent
veritatem quod sancta Romana ecclesia, catholica et
apostolica, nullis synodicis constitutis principaliter sed
evangelica voce Domini et salvatoris nostri primatum
obtinuit in Petro quando Dominus prefecit beatum
Petrum fidelibus universis. Nec per alium modum
obtinuit principatum super alias ecclesias nisi quia
Dominus beatum Petrum pretulit omnibus, nullam tunc
de Romana ecclesia faciens mencionem. Sed beatus
Petrus postea ibi sedem elegit, et ideo ex tunc
auctoritate Dei, qui voluit illam sedem quam Petrus
eligeret esse primam, Romana ecclesia primatum
obtinuit.

They grant, therefore, that the words of Pelagius
contain the truth that the holy Roman church,
catholic and apostolic, acquired primacy in [the
person of] Peter not mainly by the decrees of a synod
but by the gospel word of our Lord and Saviour when
the Lord set Peter above all the believers. And he did
not acquire dominion over other churches by any
other means except because the Lord preferred
blessed Peter to everyone, making no mention at that
time of the Roman church. But blessed Peter later
chose that place for his see and therefore forthwith
the Roman church acquired primacy by the authority
of God who wanted that see which Peter chose to be
first.

Ad secundam racionem multipliciter respondetur. Uno
modo dicitur quod Romana ecclesia privilegium super
alias ecclesias posset amittere quia posset papa
transferre sedem papalem de Roma ad aliam civitatem,
sicut Beatus Petrus transtulit de Anciochia sedem in
Romam. Aliter dicitur quod licet Romana ecclesia
possit ad tempus et de facto amittere privilegium super
alias ecclesias, non tamen simpliciter, quia si Romana
ecclesia rediret ad fidem ipsa recuperaret idem
privilegium quod habuit ante. Tercio dicitur quod
Romana ecclesia, distinguendo ipsam contra papam qui
gubernat ipsam, potest simpliciter amittere privilegium
absque translacione sedis, quia illud privilegium
consistit principaliter in potestate eligendi summum
pontificem et ordinandi apostolicam sedem. Sed hoc
privilegium potest amittere absque translacione sedis,
sicut quondam amisit. Nam, sicut habetur dist. 63, c.
Adrianus, hoc ius habuit Karolus magnus, et postea
obtinuit Otto primus rex Theotonicorum, sicut legitur
eadem dist. c. In synodo. Ergo ecclesia Romana
privilegium suum potest amittere.

There are many replies to the second argument. In
one way it is said that the Roman church could lose
its privilege over other churches because the pope
could transfer the papal see from Rome to another
city, just as blessed Peter transferred his see from
Antioch to Rome. In another way it is said that
although the Roman church can for a time and in fact
lose its privilege over other churches yet it does not
do so utterly because if the Roman church were to
return to the faith it would recover the same privilege
it had before. In a third way it is said that, by
distinguishing it from the pope who governs it, the
Roman church can lose its privilege simply without
the translation of its see, because that privilege
consists principally in the power to choose the
highest pontiff and to ordain to the apostolic see. But
it can lose this privilege without its see being
transferred, just as it did lose it once. For as we find
in dist. 63, c. Adrianus [col.241], Charlemagne had
this right, and later Otto, the first king of the
Germans, acquired it, as we read in c. In synodo of
the same distinction [col.241]. Therefore the Roman
church can lose its privilege.
