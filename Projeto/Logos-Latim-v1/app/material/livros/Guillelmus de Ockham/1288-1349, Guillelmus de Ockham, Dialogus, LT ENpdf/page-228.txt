universalis ecclesia ubicumque fuerint catholici et
fideles. Et hec ecclesia que vocatur catholica et
apostolica que errare non potest ita comprehendit
Pisanos et Lumbardos, Gallicos, Yspanos, Marchianos
et Germanos sicut Romanos; et de ista ecclesia sola
concedunt isti quod errare non potest.

church is the church universal wherever there have
been believing catholics. And this church which is
called catholic and apostolic and which can not err
comprises Pisans and Lombards, French and
Spaniards, those from Ancona and Germans, as well
as Romans. And of this church only do they grant
that it can not err.

Quinta racio eorum est hec. Ecclesia Romana que est
una ecclesia particularis sive comprehendat omnes
Romanos sive clerum Romanum tantummodo sive
papam cum cardinalibus. Non est magis electa a Deo
quam fuerit gens Iudeorum, de qua Christus fuit carnem
suscepturus humanam, quam principaliter salvare
venerat, ipso dicente Matthei 15, "Non sum missus nisi
ad oves que perierunt domus Israel"; sed gens illa non
fuit confirmata in fide quin potuit errare. Ergo nec
ecclesia Romana est confirmata in fide quin possit
errare.

Their fifth argument is this. The Roman church
which is one particular church is comprised either of
all Romans or of the Roman clergy only or of the
pope with the cardinals. It has not been more chosen
by God than was the nation of the Jews, as a member
of which Christ was to receive human flesh and
which principally he had come to save, as he himself
said in Matthew 15[:24], "I was not sent but to the
sheep that are lost of the house of Israel"; but that
nation was not confirmed in faith so that it was not
able to err. The church of Rome, therefore, has not
been confirmed in faith either so that it is not able to
err.

Discipulus Per istam racionem probaretur quod tota
multitudo Christianorum posset contra fidem errare,
sicut tota multitudo gentis Iudeorum errare potuit contra
fidem.

Student: It would be proved by that argument that
the whole multitude of Christians could err against
faith, just as the whole multitude of the nation of the
Jews was able to err against faith.

Magister Respondetur quod argumentum non procedit
de tota multitudine Christianorum sicut de Romana
ecclesia, quia extra universalem ecclesiam non potest
esse salus, eo quod Christus numquam aliam legem
preter Christianam est daturus, quemadmodum daturus
fuit aliam legem preter legem Iudeorum. Extra autem
ecclesiam Romanam que est ecclesia particularis potest
esse salus. Multi enim preter Romanos salvantur, et
ideo licet argumentum predictum concludat de ecclesia
Romana, que potest errare sicut potuit errare multitudo
Iudeorum, non tamen concludit de ecclesia universali.

Master: It is replied that the argument is not valid of
the whole multitude of Christians as it is of the
Roman church because there can not be salvation
outside the universal church, in that Christ will never
provide another law in addition to the Christian law
in the way that he was going to provide another law
in addition to the law of the Jews. There can be
salvation, however, outside the Roman church which
is a particular church, for many people are saved
apart from Romans. And therefore although the
above argument is conclusive of the Roman church,
which can err just as the multitude of Jews was able
to err, it is nevertheless not conclusive of the
universal church.

Sexta eorum racio accipitur ex predictis, quia omnis
ecclesia extra quam potest esse salus potest contra
fidem errare. Extra ecclesiam autem Romanam potest
esse salus, quemadmodum post ascensionem Christi fuit
salus antequam Romana fuerit ecclesia. Ergo ecclesia
Romana potest contra fidem errare.

Their sixth argument is taken from the preceding
[remarks], because every church outside which there
can be salvation can err against faith. There can be
salvation outside the Roman church, however, as
there was after Christ's ascension before there was a
Roman church. Therefore the Roman church can err
against faith.

Septima eorum racio est hec. Illa ecclesia que contra
fidem errare non potest non indiget aliorum consilio pro
questionibus fidei terminandis. Ecclesia autem Romana
indiget aliorum consilio in questionibus fidei
terminandis, aliter enim ad terminandas et diffiniendas
questiones motas de fide congregarentur inutiliter
generalia concilia. Ergo ecclesia Romana potest errare

Their seventh argument is this. That church which
can not err against faith does not need the advice of
others to determine questions of faith. However the
Roman church does need the advice of others in
determining questions of faith, for otherwise it would
be useless to assemble general councils to determine
and define questions raised about the faith. Therefore
