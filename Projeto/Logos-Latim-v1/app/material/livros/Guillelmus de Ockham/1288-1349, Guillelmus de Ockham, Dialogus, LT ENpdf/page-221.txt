fuit inter omnes ecclesias. Beatus autem Petrus
priusquam Rome sedem habuit Anciochie sicut hic
dicitur. Quod eciam asserit Anacletus, dicens ubi prius,
"Tercia vero sedes apud Anciochiam eiusdem beati Petri
apostoli habetur honorabilis, quam illic priusquam
Romam veniret habuit." Et hiis concordat Ancius papa,
ut scribitur 7, q. 1, c. Mutaciones, dicens, "Petrus, factus
magister noster et princeps apostolorum, de Anciochia
civitate utilitatis causa est translatus Romam, ut ibidem
pocius proficere posset." Ex hiis habetur quod sedes
beati Petri primo fuit Anciochie, ubi, sicut in cronicis
reperitur, sedit annis septem; et ita ecclesia Anciochena
septem annis super omnes ecclesias et super Romanam,
si tunc aliqui Romani conversi fuerunt, obtinuit
principatum.

his see was the first among all churches. Before
blessed Peter had his see at Rome, however, it was
at Antioch, as is said here. Anacletus affirms this
too, saying in the text cited above [dist. 22, c.
Sacrosancta; col.73], "The third see at Antioch is
held to be honourable [from the name] of the
blessed apostle Peter. He held the see there before
he went to Rome." Pope Anterius agrees with the
above when he says, as is written at 7, q. 1, c.
Mutaciones [col.579], "Having been made our
master and the chief of the apostles Peter was
transferred for the sake of usefulness from the city
of Antioch to Rome so that he might be able to
make more progress there." We find from these
[words] that blessed Peter's see was first at Antioch
where he remained for seven years, as we find in the
chronicles; and so the church of Antioch for seven
years possessed dominion over all churches, even
the Roman church, if any Romans were converted at
that time.

Tercia assercio quam colligunt ex predictis est quod
Romana
ecclesia
post
Anciochenam
obtinuit
principatum, et ita post ascensionem Domini fluxerunt
undecim anni antequam ecclesia Romana haberet super
alias ecclesias principatum. Ex quo concludunt quod ante
ascensionem Domini nequaquam habuit principatum.

The third assertion that they infer from the above
[texts] is that the Roman church obtained dominion
after [the church] of Antioch, and so eleven years
flowed by after the Lord's ascension before the
Roman church obtained dominion over other
churches. They conclude from this that it did not
have dominion before the Lord's ascension.

Discipulus Si predicta vera essent, ecclesia
Hierosolymitana quatuor annis habuisset super omnes
alias ecclesias principatum, quia, sicut habetur in
cronicis, Petrus post passionem Domini, antequam
Anciochie sibi sedem eligeret, cathedram quatuor annis
tenuit, nec legitur ubi sederit nisi Hierosolymis. Ergo
Hierosolymitana ecclesia tunc super omnes alias
ecclesias tenuit principatum, quod tamen non videtur
veritatem habere.

Student: If the above were true, the church of
Jerusalem would have had dominion over all other
churches for four years because, as we find in the
chronicles, Peter held a cathedral see after the Lord's
passion for four years before he chose the see of
Antioch for himself, and we do not read that his see
was anywhere except at Jerusalem. At that time,
therefore, the Jerusalem church held dominion over
all other churches; and yet this does not seem to be
true.

Magister Ad hoc dicitur uno modo quod beatus Petrus
quatuor annis tenuit cathedram, nullam sibi ecclesiam
eligendo, sed tanquam prelatus et princeps omnium
sedebat ubicumque volebat. Sed post quatuor annos sibi
in Anciochia sedem elegit, nolens alium dum esset
ibidem preficere in episcopum. Et ideo non
Hierosolymitana ecclesia fuit prima, quia, sicut legitur in
Legenda beati Iacobi, idem Iacobus post passionem
Domini statim ab apostolis Hierosolymitanorum fuit
episcopus ordinatus, et ita Petrus illam ecclesiam sibi
non appropriavit; sed illi sicut ceteris prefuit, et preter
Petrum episcopum habuit specialem; aliter fuit de
ecclesia Anciochena.

Master: It is said to this in one way that for four
years blessed Peter did not hold any cathedral see by
choosing a church for himself, but sat as ruler and
chief of all wherever he chose. But after four years
he chose a see for himself in Antioch, not wanting to
appoint anyone else as bishop while he was there.
The church of Jerusalem was not first, therefore,
because blessed James was appointed by the
apostles as bishop of the people of Jerusalem
immediately after the Lord's passion, as we read in
his Legend, and so Peter did not make that church
his own; but he was in charge of it, as he was of the
rest, while it had its own particular bishop besides
Peter; it was otherwise with the church of Antioch.

Discipulus Adhuc cupio scire an secundum istos posset
papa transferre sedem papalem de Roma in aliam

Student: I want to know further whether the pope
was able, according to them, to transfer the papal
