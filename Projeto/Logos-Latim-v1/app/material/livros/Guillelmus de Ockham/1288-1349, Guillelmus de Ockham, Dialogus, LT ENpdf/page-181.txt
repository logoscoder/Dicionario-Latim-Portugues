vow to renounce ownership of all temporal goods
individually and even in common.
Discipulus Isti maliciose contra Iohannem 22
procedunt. Nituntur enim concludere quod vel fuit vel
est modo hereticus.

Student: They are showing that they are malicious
towards John XXII for they are trying to conclude that
he was or is now a heretic.

Magister Volo te scire quod nonnulli putant quod non
maliciose sed veraciter et insolubiliter demonstratur
quod Iohannes 22 vel fuit vel est modo hereticus, quia,
ut asserunt, nulla potest tergiversacione negari quin
doctrina sua de paupertate Christi et apostolorum eius
et de abdicacione proprietatis omnium temporalium in
speciali et eciam in communi et de paupertate
evangelica doctrine Nicolai Tercii et aliorum
summorum pontificum adversetur. Cum ergo omnia
predicta ad fidem pertineant vel ad bonos mores
necesse est quod altera istarum doctrinarum contineatur
sub heretica pravitate. Aut ergo doctrina Iohannis 22
est heretica aut doctrina Nicolai Tercii et aliorum
summorum pontificum cum eo concordancium circa
predicta est heretica. Si doctrina Iohannis 22 est
heretica, cum eam diffinierit solenniter esse tenendam,
sequitur quod ipse pertinax et hereticus est censendus.
Si autem doctrina Nicolai Tercii et aliorum summorum
pontificum est heretica, ergo Iohannes 22, quando eam
per decretalem suam que incipit Quorundam exigit
solenniter approbavit et multipliciter commendavit, fuit
hereticus reputandus, quia pravitatis heretice defensor
et fautor

Master: I want you to know that some people think it
is not shown maliciously but truly and incontestably
that John XXII either was or is now a heretic. For they
affirm that it can not by any subterfuge be denied that
his teaching about the poverty of Christ and his
apostles, about the renunciation of ownership of all
temporal goods, both individually and also in
common, and about gospel poverty is opposed to the
teaching of Nicholas III and other highest pontiffs.
Since all the above issues pertain to faith or to good
morals it is therefore necessary that one or the other of
those teachings contains heretical wickedness. Either
the teaching of John XXII is heretical, therefore, or
the teaching of Nicholas III and the other highest
pontiffs who agree with him on the above issues is
heretical. If John XXII's teaching is heretical it
follows from the fact that he solemnly declared that it
had to be held that he himself should be considered
pertinacious and a heretic. However, if the teaching of
Nicholas III and the other highest pontiffs is heretical
then when John XXII solemnly approved and in many
ways commended it in his decretal beginning
Quorundam exigit he should have been regarded as a
heretic because he was a defender and supporter of
heretical wickedness.

Unde nonnulli ex predictis formant sextamdecimam
racionem sic. Qui circa ea que fidei sunt est sibiipsi
contrarius potest errare contra fidem; papa autem
potest circa ea que fidei sunt esse sibiipsi contrarius.
Hanc probant per exemplum de Iohanne 22 qui sibiipsi
contrarius invenitur cum prius approbaverit doctrinam
Nicolai Tercii de paupertate Christi et apostolorum eius
et de abdicacione proprietatis omnium temporalium in
speciali et eciam in communi et postea contradixit
eidem.

Now from the above some people fashion a sixteenth
argument as follows. Whoever contradicts himself
about matters of faith can err against faith. However, a
pope can contradict himself about matters of faith.
They prove this by the example of John XXII who is
found to have contradicted himself since he first
approved Nicholas III's teaching about the poverty of
Christ and his apostles and about the renunciation of
the ownership of all temporal goods, both individually
and also in common, and later rejected it.

Discipulus Quamvis raciones que impugnare videntur
Johannem 22 non putem concludere, licet sint difficiles
ad solvendum, de quarum solucione sollicite cogitabo,
tamen quedam alie efficaces apparent. Unde et
probabile michi videtur quod non est impossibile quod
papa primo intret canonice et postea efficiatur
hereticus. Verum, quia veritas exagitata magis
splendescit in lucem, peto ut in contrarium allegare
nitaris.

Student: Although I do not think that the arguments
which seem to impugn John XXII are conclusive even
though they are difficult to refute - I will think
carefully about their refutation - yet there are some
others that do seem powerful. So it does indeed seem
probable to me that it is not impossible for a pope who
enters [office] canonically later to become a heretic.
Now because truth that has been criticised shines
more brightly in the sight of all, I beg you to try to
argue the opposite case.
