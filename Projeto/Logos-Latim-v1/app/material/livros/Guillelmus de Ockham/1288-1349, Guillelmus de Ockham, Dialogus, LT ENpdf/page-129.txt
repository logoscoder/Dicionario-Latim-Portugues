cupio istum modum exquisitius pertractari. Duo autem
peto ut circa hunc modum discutias, ad quem videlicet
spectat errantem corripere, et qualis debet esse ista
correctio quae est sufficiens et legitima reputanda.

to me I want that way investigated more carefully. I
ask you to discuss two [questions] about this way,
namely to whom does it belong to correct someone
erring and what kind of correction should it be that is
to be regarded as sufficient and legitimate.

Magister Videndum primo est de correctione, secundo
de corripiente.

Master We should see about correction first and
secondly about the one correcting.

Discipulus Tene ordinem in procedendo quem vis.

Disciple Proceed in whatever order you wish.

Magister Quantum ad correctionem dicitur quod illa
sola correctio sufficiens est censenda et legitima qua
aperte erranti ostenditur quod assertio sua catholicae
obviat veritati ita quod iudicio intelligentium nulla
possit tergiversatione negare quin sibi sufficienter et
aperte ostensum quod error suus catholicae veritati
repugnat. Verbi gratia si quis ex ignorantia evangelii
textum ignorans diceret, sicut et quidam in Avinione
publice praedicavit, ut fertur, quod milites fregerunt
crura Christi, et sibi per textum evangelii Iohannis 19,
(ubi sic legitur, "Venerunt ergo milites et primi quidem
fregerunt crura et alterius qui crucifixus erat cum eo.
Ad Iesum autem cum venissent ut viderunt eum iam
mortuum non fregerunt eius crura.") ostenderetur
contrarium, ista correctio deberet sufficiens reputari
quia iudicio cuiuslibet intelligentis talis nulla posset
tergiversatione negare quin esset sibi aperte probatum
quod assertio sua evangelicae obviat veritati.

Master With respect to correction it is said that only
that correction should be considered sufficient and
legitimate by which it is openly shown to the one
erring that his assertion conflicts with catholic truth,
so that in the judgement of those who understand he
cannot by any evasion deny that it has been
sufficiently and openly shown to him that his error is
contrary to catholic truth. An example would be if
someone, not knowing the text of the gospel, were to
say out of ignorance, as indeed someone in Avignon
did publicly preach, so I have heard, that soldiers
broke Christ's legs, and the contrary were shown to
him from the text of the Gospel of John 19:[32-3]
where we read: "The soldiers therefore came and they
broke the legs of the first and then of the other that
was crucified with him. But after they were come to
Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they
did not break his legs." That correction would be
bound to be regarded as sufficient because on the
judgement of anyone at all who understands, such a
person could not deny by any evasion that it had been
clearly proved to him that his assertion conflicts with
the truth of the gospel.

Si quis etiam ex ignorantia dogmatizaret duas personas
sicut duas substantias fuisse in Christo et sibi per
textum synodi Ephesinae ostenderetur quod est haec
Nestorii haeresis per eandem synodum condemnata,
nulla posset tergiversatione negare quin esset sibi
aperte probatum quod assertio sua est haeresis
condemnata et per consequens quod veritati catholicae
adversatur. Et ideo talis correctio est sufficiens et
legitima reputanda.

Also if anyone were to dogmatise out of ignorance
that there had been two persons as two substances in
Christ and it were shown to him from the text of the
Synod of Ephesus that this is the heresy of Nestorius
condemned by that synod, he could not deny by any
evasion that it had been openly proved to him that his
assertion has been condemned as a heresy and that it
is as a consequence opposed to catholic truth. And
such correction, therefore, should be regarded as
sufficient and legitimate.

Secundo videndum est de corripiente, de quo sic
distinguatur. Quidam corripiunt increpando et poena
debita puniendo, quidam charitative monendo et
errorem tantummodo reprobando. Primo modo pertinet
ad praelatos et iurisdictionem habentes errantes
corripere. Secundo modo hoc spectat ad quemlibet
christianum.

Secondly we should see about the one correcting and
this is distinguished as follows. Some people correct
by rebuking and punishing with the due penalty, some
by warning charitably and only disapproving of an
error. In the first way [correction] pertains to prelates
and those having jurisdiction to correct those who err;
in the second way this pertains to any christian at all.
