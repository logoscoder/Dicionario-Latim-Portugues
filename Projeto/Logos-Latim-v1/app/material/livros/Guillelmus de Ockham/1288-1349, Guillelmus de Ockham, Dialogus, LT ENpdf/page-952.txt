Innocentius tertius qui, ut legi {*legitur
&MzNaRe} Extra, De maioritate et obedientia,
c. {om. &MzNaRe} Solitae, loquens de
pontificali dignitate seu {*dignitate seu om.
&NaRe} auctoritate et potestate regali ait, "Illa
quae praeest diebus, id est {id est: in &Re}
spiritualibus, maior est; quae vero carnalibus
{cardinalibus &Na} minor; est {*om.
&MzNaRe} ut quanta est inter solem et lunam
{trs.321 &MzNaRe} tanta inter pontifices et
reges differentia cognoscatur." Ex his aliisque
quampluribus {*Ex his aliisque quampluribus:
Ex quibus /his Mz\ /verbis add. Na\ et aliis
pluribus &MzNaRe} colligitur quod imperator
est minor papa. Ergo non est iudex eius.

priestly authority and royal power, "That
which rules over the days, that is over
spiritual matters, is greater; that is lesser
[which rules over] carnal matters; as great as
is the difference between the sun and the
moon, so great is the difference known to be
between bishops and kings." We gather from
these and many other [texts] that the emperor
is inferior to the pope. Therefore he is not the
latter's judge.

Amplius nemo est iudex iudicis sui. Sed papa
est iudex imperatoris cum ipsum valeat
excommunicare et imperator ei subsit et sibi
debeat obedire, teste beato Clemente qui, ut
legitur 2 {*11 &NaRe} {9 &Mz} q. 3, c. Si
autem nobis {*vobis &Zn} {*ait, "Si autem
vobis add. &MzNaRe} episcopis non
obedierint omnes presbyteri et reliqui clerici
omnesque principes, tam maioris ordinis quam
inferioris, atque reliqui populi non tantum
{*solum &MzNaReZn} infames sed etiam {et
&Mz} extorres a regno Dei et {*a add.
&MzNaReZn} consortio fidelium et a
liminibus {a liminibus: alii &Mz} [[gap in ms
after alii]] sanctae Dei ecclesiae alieni erunt."
Hoc {*etiam add. &NaRe} asserit Gelasius
papa {trs.231 &Na} {*qui add. &MzNaRe}, ut
habetur dist. 96, c. Duo ait, "Talibus igitur
{ergo &NaRe} institutis talibusque {et talibus
&MzNaRe} fulti {suffulti &MzNaRe}
auctoritatibus plures {*plerique &Zn}
{plurium &MzNaRe} namque {*om.
&MzNaReZn} pontificum alii reges alii
imperatores excommunicaverunt. Nam si {om.
&Mz} speciale aliquid {*aliquod &Zn} de
personis principum requiritur {*requiratur
&NaReZn} exemplum, beatus Innocentius
papa Archadium imperatorem, quia consensit
{consenserit &NaRe} ut sanctus Iohannes
Chrysostomus a sua sede {trs. &NaRe}
pelleretur, {depelleretur PeRe} {depelletur
&Na} excommunicavit." Ergo nunc {*om.

Further, no one is the judge of his own judge.
But the pope is the emperor's judge, since he
can excommunicate him and the emperor is
under him and ought to obey him, as blessed
Clement attests when he says, as we read in
11, q. 3, c. Si autem vobis [c.11, col.646],
"However if all priests, the rest of the clergy,
all princes, both of the greater and lesser
order, and the rest of the people do not obey
you bishops, they are not only of ill repute
but are also banished from the kingdom of
God and from the fellowship of the faithful
and will be inimical to the threshold of the
holy church of God." Pope Gelasius asserts
this too, as we find in dist. 96, c. Duo [sunt]
[c.10, col.340], when he says, "Upheld by
such regulations and such authorities many
bishops have pronounced excommunications,
some against kings, some against emperors.
For if some particular example concerning
the persons of the emperors is required,
blessed Pope Innocent excommunicated the
emperor Achadius because he agreed in the
expulsion of Saint John Chrisostom from his
see." The emperor is not the judge of the
pope, therefore, since the pope is his judge.
That the pope is the emperor's judge is shown
again. For as the body is in relation to the
human soul, so is the ruler of the body in
relation to the ruler of souls. But with respect
to rule the body is beneath the soul. Therefore
the ruler of bodies, that is the emperor, is
