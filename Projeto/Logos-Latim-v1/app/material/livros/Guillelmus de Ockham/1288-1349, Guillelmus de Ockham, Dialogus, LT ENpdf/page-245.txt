not err against faith.
Magister Ad hoc respondent quod Isidorus loquitur pro
illo tempore quo episcopi fuerunt catholici. Et verum est
quod concilium generale episcoporum catholicorum,
quamdiu permanserit in catholica veritate, errare non
potest. Omnes tamen illi episcopi possent contra fidem
errare eciam cum omnibus clericis suis.

Master: They reply to this that Isidore is speaking
about a time when bishops were catholic, and it is
true that as long as it remains in catholic truth a
general council of catholic bishops can not err.
Nevertheless all those bishops, along with all their
clergy, could err against faith.

Discipulus Dic quomodo respondent ad terciam
racionem.

Student: Tell me how they reply to the third
argument.

Magister Ad terciam racionem respondent isti quod si
concilium generale contra fidem erraret ab ipso
appellare liceret. Et cum dicitur quod non ad aliud
concilium, dicunt quod ad aliud concilum generale, si
daretur facultas aliud concilium congregandi, appellare
liceret. Et si iterum illud concilium erraret, liceret ad
aliud appellare, et sic semper quousque catholici
convenirent. Iterum si papa non esset presens in
concilio generali, si concilium erraret contra fidem, ad
ipsum papam appellare liceret, vel ad papam cum alio
concilio congregando. Ad ecclesiam eciam universalem,
si convenire posset, esset principaliter appellandum. Si
vero Christianitas in tantum esset pravitate infecta
heretica quod papa et cardinales et prelati et clerici et
principes ac potentes essent heretici, et soli pauci
simplices et pauperes in fide manerent catholica, et
concilium reputatum generale contra fidem erraret,
aliud non restaret fidelibus quam dolor et gemitus
consiliumque tenere beati Hieronimi quod dat viro
ecclesiastico et prudenti quando in ea que vocatur
domus Dei invalescit iniquitas et iusticia omnino
deprimitur. Qui, ut recitatur 11, q. 3, c. Quando ergo,
ait, "Quando ergo vir ecclesiasticus et prudens atque
intelligens multas impietates in ea que vocatur domus
Dei esse cognoverit, et non solum multas sed eciam
fortes et que opprimere possunt iusticiam, et in tantum
doctorum rabiem processisse ut accipiant precium in
iudicio et omnia pro muneribus faciant, pauperes
devitent in portis et audire contemnant. Taceat in illo
tempore ne det sanctum canibus et mittat margaritas
inter porcos, qui conversi conculcent eas, et imitetur
Ieremiam dicentem, 'Solus sedebam quia amaritudine
plenus eram.'" Sic vir catholicus et fidelis, quando
multas hereses esse in Christianitate cognoverit et
corruisse veritatem catholicam in plateis et in tantum
prelatorum, doctorum, clericorum, potentum et
principum rabiem processisse ut fidem conentur
destruere orthodoxam, doctrinam sanctorum patrum
audire contemnant, veritatis catholice defensores
occidant, tribulent, persequantur et infestent, taceat in
ipso tempore nec publice coram eis appellet, ne det
sanctum canibus et mittat margaritas ante porcos, qui
conversi conculcent eas, Scripturas Sacras perperam
exponendo et ipsas repugnantes ad falsitatem hereticam
distorquendo; et imitetur Ieremiam dicentem, "Solus

Master: They reply to the third argument that if a
general council were to err against faith, it would be
permissible to appeal from it. And when it is said that
[there could] not [be an appeal] to another council,
they say that it would be permissible to appeal to
another general council if an opportunity were given
to call together another council. And if that council in
its turn were to err, it would be permissible to appeal
to another. And it would always be so until catholics
were to come together. Again, if the pope were not
present at a general council, it would be permissible
to appeal to the pope himself if the council were to
err or to the pope together with another council that
was to be summoned. Appeal should chiefly be made
to the universal church if it were able to come
together. But if Christianity were so infected with
heretical wickedness that the pope, the cardinals,
prelates, the clergy, rulers and the powerful were
heretics, and only a few simple, poor people
remained in the catholic faith, while the council
regarded as general were to err against faith, nothing
would remain for the faithful but sorrow and grief
and the holding onto the advice that blessed Jerome
gives a prudent churchman when wickedness prevails
in what is called the house of God and justice is
completely oppressed. As is recorded at 11, q. 3, c.
Quando ergo [col.650] , he says, "Therefore when a
prudent and intelligent churchman learns that there
are many impieties in what is called the house of
God, and that they are not only many but also strong
and able to oppress justice, and that the madness of
the learned has gone so far that they accept money
for judgement and do everything in return for gifts,
let the poor escape from them within their gates and
disdain to listen to them. Let him be silent at that
time, lest he give what is holy to dogs and throw
pearls before swine which, turning, will trample him,
and let them imitate Jeremiah when he says, 'I sat
alone because I was full of bitterness.'" In the same
way, when a catholic believer learns that there are
many heresies in Christianity and that catholic truth
has fallen among the mob and that the madness of
prelates, the learned, the clergy, the powerful and the
rulers has proceeded so far that they are trying to
destroy orthodox faith, are disdaining to listen to the
