Item {iterum &Na} sicut luna recipit lumen a
sole sic {*ita &NaRe} in multis imperator debet
recipere directionem a papa quando est
catholicus bonus et sapiens, scilicet in causis
divinis {*dei &NaRe}. Quantum autem ad multa
alia non est simile, sicut dictum est {*supra add.
&NaRe}.

Again, just as the moon receives light
from the sun, so the emperor, in many
matters, in God's causes for instance,
ought to receive direction from the pope,
when he is catholic, good and wise. With
respect to many other things, however,
there is no similarity, as was said above.

Discipulus Adhuc aliam rationem adducas.

Student Would you bring forward yet
another argument?

Magister Alia ratio talis est {trs. &Md}.
Ecclesia est unum corpus; ergo {ipsa add. &Md}
habet unum caput. Sed imperator non est caput.
Ergo papa {non add. &NaRe} est caput
ecclesiae. A capite autem derivatur virtus {vultus
&Mz} in membra. Ergo imperator {*qui add.
&NaRe} est membrum ecclesiae et {*om.
&MzNaRe} non caput et per consequens {*et
per consequens om. &NaRe} recipere debet
virtutem {*trs.321 &MdMzNaPeRe} a papa sicut
{*tamquam &NaRe} a {ex &Mz} {om. &Pz}
capite. Ergo imperium est a papa {sicut a
capite ... papa om. &Md}.

Master [11] The following is another
argument. The church is one body;
therefore it has one head. But the emperor
is not the head. The pope, therefore, is the
head of the church. The strength in the
members, however, is derived from the
head. Therefore the emperor, who is a
member of the church not its head should
receive his strength from the pope as from
its head. Therefore the empire is from the
pope.

Discipulus Dic quomodo {*qualiter &NaRe}
respondetur ad hoc.

Student Tell me how this is replied to.

Magister Respondetur quod papa est caput
ecclesiae quae est congregatio fidelium. Et ideo
in spiritualibus subest imperator {*trs.
&MzNaRe} papae. Ergo illam {aliam &Pz}
{*ergo illam: et ideo aliquam &MdNaPeRe}
virtutem spiritualem et directionem {*trs.4312
&NaRe} recipere debet a papa. {Ego illam ...
papa: om. &Mz} Sed quia papa [[sed quia papa:
margin Pe]] non est caput in temporalibus ideo
imperator in temporalibus {ideo imperator in
temporalibus: om. &Mz} non subest ei nec
imperium recipere debet ab ipso.

Master The reply is that the pope is the
head of the church, which is the
congregation of the faithful. And
therefore in spiritual matters the emperor
submits to the pope. And therefore he
ought to receive from the pope some
spiritual direction and strength. But
because the pope is not head in temporal
matters, therefore the emperor does not
submit to him in temporal matters and he
ought not receive the empire from him.
