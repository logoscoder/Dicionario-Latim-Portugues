computandus, volens quod cuicunque deficit aliqua
conditionum praedictarum est haereticus et etiam
pertinax per ecclesiam iudicandus, quamvis non omnis
sit reputandus pertinax defensator haereticae pravitatis.
Prima est quod taliter errans errorem suum nulla
pertinaci animositate defendat. Si enim errorem suum
pertinaci animositate defenderet, catholici, qui de
exterioribus non de interioribus motibus animae
iudicant, debent eum inter haereticos computare,
saltem praesumtione violenta contra quam nulla est
probatio in contrarium admittenda. Esto enim quod
aliquis scienter contra conscientiam haeresim
pertinaciter defensaret, et ita in rei veritate apud Deum
non esset haereticus quamvis mortalissime peccaret,
hoc tamen probare non posset et ideo ecclesia deberet
eum inter haereticos computare.

anyone who fails to meet one of the aforesaid
conditions should be judged by the church as a heretic
and also as pertinacious, although not all of them
should be regarded as a "pertinacious defender" of
heretical wickedness. The first is that someone erring
in such a way does not defend his error with
pertinacious ill will. For if he were to defend his error
with pertinacious ill will, catholics, who judge from
externals not from interior motions of the soul, ought
to count him among the heretics at least with a violent
presumption against which no proof to the contrary
should be admitted. For granted that someone might
knowingly and pertinaciously defend a heresy against
his conscience and so in truth of fact might not be a
heretic in the eyes of God, even if he were to commit
the most mortal sin, yet he could not prove this and
therefore the church would have to count him among
the heretics.

Discipulus Magis et magis intelligo differentiam inter
haereticum pertinacem et pertinaci animositate
haeresim defendentem. Unde videtur quod potest etiam
quis aliquam haeresim pertinaci animositate defendere
licet non debeant catholici ipsum haereticum reputare,
sicut si quis metu mortis coactus ab infidelibus eorum
errores contra fideles pertinaci animositate defenderet
non esset haereticus iudicandus, quemadmodum beatus
Marcellinus, qui metu mortis actum haereticalem
commisit, fuit haereticus minime iudicatus.

Student I understand more and more the difference
between a pertinacious heretic and someone defending
a heresy with pertinacious ill will [see above].
Whence it seems that someone can even defend some
heresy with pertinacious ill will although catholics
should not regard him as a heretic, as for example if
someone were forced by unbelievers through fear of
death to defend with pertinacious ill will their errors
against believers he should not be judged a heretic,
just as blessed Marcellinus who committed a heretical
act from fear of death was not judged a heretic.

Magister Dicunt isti quod non bene intelligis quis
debeat reputari errorem pertinaci animositate
defendere, quia ille solus qui absque metu mortis
sponte et voluntarie errorem defendit errorem pertinaci
animositate defendit. Et ideo ille de quo tu ponis
exemplum, quamdiu nullum errorem defendit nisi metu
mortis, nullum errorem pertinaci animositate defendit.

Master They say that you do not understand well who
should be regarded as defending an error with
pertinacious ill will, because only he who defends an
error willingly and voluntarily without fear of death
defends it with pertinacious ill will. And therefore as
long as he whom you cite as an example does not
defend an error except from fear of death, he does not
defend an error with pertinacious ill will.

Discipulus Istud non videtur bene dictum. Nam
pertinax dicitur quasi impudenter tenax et qui in
sententia sua nimis persistit. Aliter enim nequaquam
peccaret mortaliter errorem contra conscientiam
defendendo. Ergo talis est erroris pertinax defensator,
licet propter talem pertinacem defensionem non sit
haereticus iudicandus si constat fidelibus quod
solummodo pro morte vitanda defendit errorem.

[See Significant Variants, para. 11.] Student That
does not seem to be well said. For he is said to be
pertinacious who is, as it were, shamelessly tenacious
and too persistent in his opinion. But he who defends
an error from fear of death is shamelessly tenacious
and too persistent in his opinion. For otherwise he
would not sin mortally in defending an error against
his conscience. Such a person is a pertinacious
defender of error, therefore, although he should not be
judged a heretic on account of such a pertinacious
defence if believers are certain that he is defending the
error only in order to avoid death.

Magister Argumentum forte facis contra ipsos, et ideo
forte dicerent quod talis esset pertinax reputandus. Sed
tamen non esset dicendum quod errorem pertinaci
animositate defenderet, quia animositas voluntatem

Master You make a strong argument against them,
and so perhaps they would say that such a person
should be regarded as pertinacious. But it should
nevertheless not be said that he was defending the
