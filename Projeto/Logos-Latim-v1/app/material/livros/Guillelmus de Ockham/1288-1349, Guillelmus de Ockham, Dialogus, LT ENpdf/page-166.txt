temptatus in hereticam incidat pravitatem.

too should take thought lest he be tempted by an error
against faith and fall into heretical wickedness.

Item hoc probant auctoritate Bonifacii martiris que
habetur dist. 40, c. Si papa; qui loquens de papa ait,
"Huius culpas redarguere presumit mortalium nullus;
qui cunctos ipse iudicaturus a nemine est iudicandus
nisi deprehendatur a fide devius." Ex quibus verbis
evidenter colligitur quod papa potest deviare a fide
catholica et hereticam incurrere pravitatem. Quod
glossa ibidem asserit manifeste dicens super verbo 'a
fide', "Quod intelligit Huguccio, cum papa non vult
corrigi. Si enim paratus esset corrigi non posset
accusari." Et infra: "Hic specialiter fit mencio de
heresi, ideo quia etsi occulta esset heresis, de illa
posset accusari." Et infra querit dicens, "Nunquid papa
posset statuere quod non posset accusari de heresi?" Et
respondet dicens: "Respondeo quod non, quia ex hoc
periclitaretur tota ecclesia." Ex hiis verbis patenter
habetur quod papa potest de heresi accusari et per
consequens potest pravitate heretica irretiri.

Again, they prove this by a text of Boniface the
martyr which is found in dist. 40, c. Si papa [col.146];
speaking about the pope he says, "No mortal
presumes to convict him of faults; he who is going to
judge everyone else should be judged by no one
unless he is discovered deviating from the faith." We
gather evidently from these words that the pope can
deviate from catholic faith and fall into heretical
wickedness. The gloss on that text clearly affirms this
when it says about the phrase 'from the faith'
[col.195], " Huguccio understands this to mean when
the pope refuses to be corrected. For if he were
prepared to be corrected he could not be accused. ...
Mention is especially made here of heresy because
even if the heresy were secret he could still be
accused of it." And he goes on to ask, "Would the
pope be able to decree that he could not be accused of
heresy?" In reply he says, "I answer no, because the
whole church would be endangered by it." We clearly
learn from these words that the pope can be accused
of heresy and, as a consequence, can be ensnared by
heretical wickedness.

Item eandem assercionem auctoritate Urbani pape que
ponitur 25, q. 1, c. Sunt quidam nituntur astruere. Ait
enim Urbanus papa, "Sciendum summopere est quia
inde novas leges potest condere, unde evangeliste
aliquid nequaquam dixerunt. Ubi vero aperte Dominus
vel eius apostoli aut eos sequentes sancti patres
sentencialiter aliquid diffinierunt, ibi non novam legem
Romanus pontifex dare sed pocius, quod predicatum
est, usque ad animam et sanguinem confirmare debet.
Si enim quod docuerunt apostoli et prophete destruere,
quod absit, niteretur, non sentenciam dare sed magis
errare convinceretur." Ex hiis insinuatur quod quamvis
Romanus pontifex non debeat tamen potest errare
contra apostolos et prophetas et ita potest heretica infici
pravitate. Quod glosse multe super decreta
sentencialiter et vocaliter asserunt et affirmant. Glossa
enim 24, q. 1, c. 1 ait, "Hic", scilicet si quando quis
incidit in heresim iam dampnatam, "est casus in quo
papa papam ligare potest, in quo papa in canonem late
sentencie incidit. Nec obstat illa regula quod par parem
solvere vel ligare non potest, quia si papa hereticus est
in eo quod hereticus est minor est quocumque
catholico."

Again, they try to add to the same assertion by a text
of Pope Urban which is put in 25, q. 1, c. Sunt quidam
[col,1008]. For Pope Urban says, "It should be known
most diligently that the reason why in some cases he
can establish new laws, is because in those cases the
evangelists said nothing. But when the Lord or his
apostles or the holy fathers who followed them have
implicitly defined something the Roman pontiff
should not give a new law but rather should confirm
what has been proclaimed even with their soul and
blood. For if he were to strive, may it not be so, to
destroy what the apostles and prophets have taught he
would be convicted not of giving an opinion but rather
of making an error." This implies that although the
Roman pontiff should not err against [the teaching of]
the apostles and prophets, nevertheless he can do so,
and so he can be corrupted by heretical wickedness.
This is asserted and affirmed both implicitly and
explicitly by many glosses on the decretals. For the
gloss on 24, q. 1, c. 1 says [s. v. heresim; col.1382],
"This is a case", that is when someone falls into an
already condemned heresy, "in which a pope can bind
a pope, in which the pope falls under the canon of
published opinion. The rule that an equal can not
release or bind an equal is not an objection because
from the very fact that the pope is a heretic he is less
than any catholic whatsoever."

Item eadem causa et q. c. A recta: dicit glossa, "Quero,
de qua ecclesia intelligas quod dicitur quod non possit
errare? Non de ipso papa qui ecclesia dicitur, ut supra

Again, the gloss on the chapter A recta in the same
causa and quaestio says [s. v. novitatibus; col.1387],
"I ask of which church you understand it to be said
