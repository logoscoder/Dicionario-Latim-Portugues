of his office greater than the emperor in such
things and than all other secular judges.

Magister {om. &Re} Respondetur tibi quod
sicut inferiores auctoritate legis supplent
negligentiam superioris, ita papa virtute
consuetudinis quae {qui &Mz} aequipollet
{*aequivalet &NaRe} legi supplet
negligentiam iudicum secularium. Et ideo {*et
ideo: quare &NaRe} auctoritate officii sui non
supplet negligentiam talem. Et ideo non est
maior in huiusmodi {huius &Re} causis
{*iudicibus add. &MzNaRe} secularibus.

Master The reply to you is that just as
inferiors make good the negligence of their
superior by the authority of law, so it is by
virtue of custom, which is equivalent to law,
that the pope makes good the negligence of
secular judges. Therefore he does not make
good such negligence by the authority of his
office. And therefore he is not greater in
cases of this kind than secular judges.

Discipulus Cuius auctoritate vel consensu
potest introduci talis consuetudo quae tribuat
papae huiusmodi {huius &Re} potestatem?

Student By whose authority or consent can
such a custom, which bestows on the pope
power of this kind, be introduced?

Magister Ad hoc tibi {*tripliciter &NaRe}
respondetur: uno modo quod potest introduci
huiusmodi {*om. &NaRe} consuetudo
auctoritate vel consensu tacito vel expresso
imperatoris et iudicum secularium quibus
potest placere quod papa negligentiam suppleat
eorundem aut possunt scienter tolerare quod
hoc faciat papa. Aliter diciter quod potest
introduci auctoritate populi qui velint vel
consentiant {*velint vel consentiant: velit vel
consentiat &NaRe} quod papa huiusmodi
habeat potestatem. Aliter dicitur quod potest
introduci auctoritate sive ratione {*sive ratione
om. &NaRe} naturalis rationis {*trs. &NaRe}
quae dictat quod iustitia est nullatenus
negligenda quin {quando &Mz} semper in
communitate servetur.

Master This is replied to in three ways: in
one way, that such a custom can be
introduced by the tacit or express authority or
consent of the emperor and the secular
judges, to whom it can be soothing that the
pope makes good their negligence, or they
can knowingly tolerate the pope's doing this.
In another way it is said that it can be
introduced by the authority of the people who
want the pope to have or agree to his having
power of this kind. In another way it is said
that it can be introduced on the authority of
natural reason which prescribes that justice
should not be neglected but rather is always
preserved in a community.

Discipulus Nunquid possent imperator et
Student Could the emperor and secular
iudices seculares talem consuetudinem tollere? judges abolish such a custom?
Magister Respondetur quod secundum istam
{*illam &NaRe} assertionem quae ponit quod
talis consuetudo potest introduci de consensu
tacito vel expresso imperatoris et iudicum
secularium, imperator posset eam tollere sed
non alii iudices seculares. Quia enim

Master The reply is that according to that
assertion which puts it that such a custom can
be introduced with the tacit or express
agreement of the emperor and secular judges,
the emperor could remove it but not the
secular judges. For because the prescription is
by imperial law and is not from inferior
