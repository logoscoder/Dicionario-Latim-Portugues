Magister Dicunt quod talis veritas esset tanquam
catholica acceptanda quia talis concors adhaesio
omnium christianorum nullo excepto alicui assertioni
huiusmodi sine miraculo non posset contingere. Cum
enim omnes fideles firmissime teneant quod iuxta
promissionem Salvatoris Matthaei ultimo, "Vobiscum
sum usque ad consummationem seculi", ecclesia
universalis nunquam errabit, constat quod sine
inspiratione divina speciali nunquam ecclesia
universalis assertioni quae non dependet ex doctrina
ecclesiae praecedenti firmiter adhaerebit, et ita si
unquam tali veritati adhaerebit miraculose adhaerebit,
et ideo tunc miraculum fieri esset credendum.

Master They say that such a truth should be accepted
as catholic because such a harmonious agreement of
all christians with no exception could not occur in
connection with any assertion of this kind without a
miracle. For since all believers most firmly hold, in
accordance with the Saviour's promise in the last
chapter of Matthew [28:20], "I am with you always, to
the end of the age", that the church universal will
never err, it is certain that without special divine
inspiration the universal church will never cling
firmly to an assertion which does not derive from
earlier teaching of the church, and so if it does ever
cling to such a truth it will cling miraculously, and
therefore it should be believed that a miracle has
happened.

Discipulus Quid sentiunt si omnes christiani praeter
paucos vel unum assertioni tali quae ex doctrina
ecclesiae praecedenti probari non posset noviter
adhaererent?

Student What do they think if all christians except a
few or one were newly to adhere to an assertion of
this kind which could not be proved from the previous
teaching of the church?

Magister Dicunt quod si unus solus dissentiret non
esset talis veritas acceptanda quia in uno solo potest
stare tota fides ecclesiae, quemadmodum tempore
mortis Christi tota fides catholica in sola beata virgine
remanebat, nec est credendum quod omni tempore post
tempora apostolorum sint aliqui magis accepti Deo
quam fuerunt apostoli ante mortem Christi. Si igitur
Christus post crucifixionem suam permisit cunctos
apostolos a fide catholica deviare et solam beatam
virginem firmiter permanere in fide temerarium est
asserere quod nunquam ante finem mundi Deus
permitteret totam multitudinem christianorum praeter
unum a fide recedere orthodoxa.

Master They say that if only one person were to
dissent, such a truth should not be accepted because
the whole faith of the church can abide in one single
person, just as in the time of Christ's death the whole
catholic faith endured in the blessed virgin alone, and
it should not be believed that at any time after the
times of the apostles some people were more accepted
by God than the apostles were before the death of
Christ. If therefore after his crucifixion Christ
permitted all the apostles to turn aside from the
catholic faith and the blessed virgin alone to endure
firmly in the faith it is rash to assert that never before
the end of the world would God permit the whole
multitude of christians except one to withdraw from
orthodox faith.

Discipulus Ista nescio improbare, sed videtur quod ad
hoc quod omnes catholici teneantur alicui veritati
noviter revelatae firmiter adhaerere non sufficit eam
operatione miraculi confirmare cum per malos et
infideles fiant miracula, sicut ex verbis evangelii
Matthei 7 colligitur, ut apparet Christo dicente, "Multi
dicent mihi in illa die, Domine, Domine, nonne in
nomine tuo prophetavimus, et in nomine tuo daemonia
eiecimus, et in nomine tuo virtutes multas fecimus? Et
tunc confitebor illis, quia nunquam novi vos," hoc est
nunquam approbavi vos. Huic etiam concordat glossa
Extra, De haereticis, c. Cum ex iniuncto dicens,
"Quandoque miracula fiunt per malos."

Student I do not know how to disprove these things,
but it seems that for all catholics to be bound to
adhere firmly to some newly revealed truth it is not
enough to confirm it with the working of a miracle
since miracles are performed by the wicked and by
unbelievers, as we gather, so it seems, from the words
of the gospel of Matthew, 7[:22-3] when Christ says,
"Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have
not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out demons
in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?'
And then I will profess unto them, 'I never knew
you.'", that is I never approved you. The gloss on
Extra, De hereticis, c. Cum ex iniuncto [col.1678, s.v.
miraculi] agrees with this too, saying, "Sometimes
miracles are performed by the wicked."

Magister Ad istam obiectionem respondent dicentes
quod, licet per malos fiant miracula, nunquam tamen
fit verum miraculum ad confirmationem falsitatis
asserte per malos; et ideo quando docent aliquem

Master They reply to that objection by saying that
although miracles are performed by the wicked, yet a
true miracle is never performed to confirm a falsity
asserted by the wicked; and therefore when they teach
