quod est pars dicte dioecesis poterit errare contra fidem.

against faith, according to them, yet the college of
cardinals which is part of that diocese can err against
faith.

Ad septimam respondetur quod si collegium
cardinalium contra fidem erraret, invenirentur alii
Christiani qui eis auderent resistere quia timor mortis
eos nequaquam retraheret a confessione et defensione
veritatis catholice, sicut temporibus imperatorum qui
erant domini mundi et multo maioris potencie
temporalis quam sint cardinales, multi sancti martyres
fidem catholicam confitebantur et pro viribus
defensabant.

A reply to the seventh is that if the college of
cardinals were to err against faith other christians
would be found who would dare to resist them
because fear of death would not drag them away
from the confession and defence of catholic truth,
just as in the times of the emperors, who were lords
of the world and of much greater temporal power
than are cardinals, many holy martyrs confessed the
catholic faith and defended it according to their
ability.

Discipulus Nunc non invenirentur tales.

Student: Such people would not be found now.

Magister Dicitur quod sic. Si enim nunc quamplurimi
seculares se pro defensione temporalium contra totum
collegium cardinalium opponunt, non est incredibile
reputandum quin aliqui exponerent se pro defensione
fidei si collegium cardinalium fidem catholicam
impugnaret.

Master: It is said that they would be. For if very
many seculars now oppose the whole college of
cardinals to defend temporal goods, it ought not be
regarded as incredible that some of them would risk
much for the defence of the faith if the college of
cardinals were to attack the catholic faith.

Discipulus Dic quomodo respondetur ad octavam
racionem.

Student: Tell me how answer is made to the eighth
argument.

Magister Ad octavam racionem dicitur quod collegium
episcoporum posset errare contra fidem, nec est certum,
nec per Scripturam Divinam nec per doctrinam
universalis ecclesie nec per doctrinam sanctorum, quod
omnes episcopi tempore Antichristi vel in alio tempore
a fide catholica minime aberrabunt; immo estimant
aliqui, quamvis ad hoc fundamentum solidum habere
non possint, quod sicut pontifices et Pharisei
crucifixerunt Christum ita episcopi et religiosi ac clerici
erunt principales sectatores Antichristi, nec aliquis
clericus sive religiosus se sibi opponet.

Master: To the eighth argument it is said that the
college of bishops could err against faith and that it is
not certain, either from divine Scripture, from the
teaching of the universal church or from the teaching
of the saints, that all the bishops in the time of antiChrist or in another time will not stray from the
catholic faith. Indeed some people think, although
they can not have a strong foundation for this, that
just as the priests and Pharisees crucified Christ so
bishops, religious and clerics will be the principal
followers of anti-Christ and that no cleric or religious
will oppose him.

Discipulus Hoc est temerarie dictum eciam, esto quod
non sit certum an aliqui clerici Antichristo resistent:
ideo transi et indica quomodo respondetur ad nonam
racionem.

Student: This is rashly said too, given that it is not
certain whether some clerics would resist anti-Christ.
So pass on and indicate how reply is made to the
ninth argument.

Magister Ad nonam racionem dicitur quod collegium
cardinalium posset accusari de heresi; et cum dicitur
quod inferiores superiores accusare non possunt, hoc
negatur in multis casibus.

Master: It is said to the ninth argument that the
college of cardinals could be accused of heresy, and
when it is said that inferiors can not accuse inferiors
this is denied in many cases.

Ad decimam respondetur quod simplices non
salvarentur in fide cardinalium si hereticarentur, sed
salvarentur in fide apostolorum et aliorum sanctorum
qui credebant explicite id quod simplices credunt
implicite. Unde quod dicitur quod simplices salvantur in
fide maiorum vel in fide ecclesie, debet intelligi quod

The reply to the tenth is that the simple would not be
saved in the faith of the cardinals if they were to
become heretical but would be saved in the faith of
the apostles and other saints who explicitly believed
what the simple believe implicitly. So when it is said
that the simple are saved in the faith of the elders or
