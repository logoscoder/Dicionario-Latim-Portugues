ceteris ecclesiis prelata sed evangelica voce Domini et
Salvatoris nostri primatum obtinuit." Ergo hec ecclesia
Romana errare non potest.

find in dist. 21, c. Quamvis, he says [col.70],
"Although all the catholic churches established
throughout the world make up the one marriage bed
of Christ, yet the holy Roman church, catholic and
apostolic, preferred to the rest of the churches not by
the decrees of synods but by the word of our Lord
and Saviour in the gospel, has acquired primacy."
Therefore this Roman church can not err.

Secundo sic: illa ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest
que privilegium super alias ecclesias non potest amittere,
quia eo ipso quod quecumque ecclesia hereticaretur
omne privilegium super quoscumque orthodoxos
amitteret cum omnes heretici quibuscumque catholicis
sunt minores (24, q. 1, para. Si autem). Ecclesia autem
Romana privilegium super alias ecclesias non potest
amittere, quia si posset privilegium amittere non esset
hereticus reputandus qui auferre sibi privilegium
conaretur, cum pro assercione illius quod potest
veritatem habere non sit quis inter hereticos numerandus.
Sed qui privilegium Romane ecclesie auferre conatur in
hereticam labitur pravitatem, teste Nicolao papa qui, ut
habetur dist. 22, c. 1, loquens de Romana ecclesia que
est distincta contra alias ecclesias ait, "Non dubium est
quia quisquis cuiuslibet ecclesie ius suum detrahit
iniusticiam facit. Qui autem Romane ecclesie
privilegium ab ipso summo omnium capite ecclesiarum
traditum auferre conatur hic proculdubio in heresim
labitur, et cum ille vocetur iniustus hic est dicendus
hereticus." Ex quibus verbis habetur quod qui conatur
auferre privilegium Romane ecclesie hereticus est
dicendus, et per consequens tale privilegium a Romana
ecclesia auferri non potest. Et per consequens ipsa
hereticari non potest, quia eo ipso quod hereticaretur
omne privilegium perderet.

Secondly [it is shown] as follows. That church can
not err against faith which can not lose its privilege
over other churches, because any church at all that
was to become heretical would thereby lose every
privilege over all the orthodox, since all heretics are
less than any catholic at all (24, q. 1, para. Si autem
[col.967]). However the Roman church can not lose
its privilege over other churches because if it could
lose its privilege anyone who tried to take away this
privilege from it would not have to be regarded as a
heretic, since no one should be counted among
heretics for an assertion that can be true. But
whoever tries to take away the Roman church's
privilege falls into heretical wickedness, as Pope
Nicholas attests. Speaking about the Roman church
which is distinguished from other churches he says,
as we find in dist. 22, c. 1 [col.73], "There is no
doubt that anyone who takes away from any church
its right does an injustice. However whoever tries to
take away from the Roman church a privilege given
to it by that highest head of all churches
undoubtedly falls into heresy, and since the former
is called unjust this latter should be called a heretic."
We find from these words that whoever tries to take
away a privilege of the Roman church should be
called a heretic, and consequently such a privilege
can not be taken away from the Roman church. And
as a consequence of this it can not become heretical
because if it were to become heretical it would lose
every privilege.

Tercio sic: illa ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest
sine qua nulla ecclesia catholica valet regi, quia Deus
ecclesiam universalem non rectam numquam usque ad
finem seculi non derelinquet. Ergo nec usque ad finem
seculi derelinquet illam ecclesiam sine qua nulla ecclesia
regitur; sed sine ecclesia Romana nulla ecclesia catholica
valet rite disponi, teste Anacleto papa qui, ut habetur
dist. 22, c. Sacrosancta, ait, "Hec vero apostolica sedes
caput et cardo, ut prefatum est, a Domino et non ab alio
constituta est, et sicut cardine ostium regitur sic huius
sancte apostolice sedis auctoritate omnes ecclesie
Domino disponente reguntur." Ergo hec sedes apostolica
que est Romana ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest.

Thirdly, [it is shown] as follows. That church can
not err against faith without which no catholic
church can be ruled, because God will never, to the
end of the age, leave the universal church unruled.
Therefore to the end of the age he will not abandon
that church without which no church is ruled; but
without the Roman church no catholic church can be
properly managed, as Pope Anacletus attests. He
says, as we find in dist. 22, c. Sacrosancta [col.73],
"Now this apostolic see was established, as was said
before, as head and hinge by the Lord and not by
anyone else and, just as a door is governed by its
hinge, so, with the Lord arranging it, all churches
are governed by the authority of this holy apostolic
see." Therefore this apostolic see which is the
Roman church can not err against faith.
