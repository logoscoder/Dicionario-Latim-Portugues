Magister Non est omnino simile de Christo et
de papa. Quia enim papa est vicarius Christi,
ideo non habet omnem potestatem, quam
habuit Christus, etiam in quantum homo.
Christus enim etiam in quantum homo instituit
sacramenta et sponte instituit, ita quod potuit
dispensare contra ipsa quod tamen papa non
potest. Papa ergo, cum sit solummodo vicarius
Christi, servare tenetur ea que Christus verbo
et exemplo docuit servanda. Cum ergo
Christus subdens se aliis exemplo docuerit
subiectionem exhibendam iudicibus, papa
huiusmodi subiectionem servare tenetur.

Master There is not a complete similarity
between Christ and the pope. For because the
pope is the vicar of Christ, he does not, as a
result, have all the power that Christ, even as
a man, had. For even as a man Christ
established the sacraments and so established
them of his own free will that he could make
a dispensation against them; yet the pope can
not do this. Since the pope is only the vicar of
Christ, therefore, he is bound to observe those
things which by teaching and example Christ
taught should be observed. Therefore since in
subjecting himself to others, Christ taught by
this example that subjection should be
tendered to judges, the pope is bound to
observe subjection of this kind.

Discipulus Potestne probari aliter, quod
Christus fuit subditus imperatori et aliis
iudicibus?

Student Can it be proved in another way that
Christ was subject to the emperor and to
other judges?

Magister Hoc probatur aliter per hoc, quod
Christus fuit subditus matri et patri putativo,
sicut legitur Luc 2:[51]. Ergo fuit subditus illis
qui fuerunt superiores et domini patris putativi
et matris {matres &Na}, quales fuerunt
Romani. Unde et Ioseph, ut legitur Luc 2:[4-5],
ascendit de Galilea in Bethleem, ut profiteretur
et faceret {faceretur &Na} se subiectum
imperatori cum Maria desponsata sibi uxore.
Ergo Christus fuit subditus, in quantum homo
mortalis, imperatori, licet sponte et voluntarie,
sicut et sponte fuit portatus a diabolo in
montem et etiam in Ierusalem, ubi statuit eum
supra propinaculum templi.

Master This is proved in another way by the
fact that Christ was subject to his mother and
his putative father, as we read in Luke 2:51.
Therefore he was subject to those who were
the superiors and lords of his putative father
and his mother, and the Romans were such
people. Whence too, as we read in Luke 2:45, Joseph went up from Galilee to Bethlehem
to be registered and to make himself and
Mary, to whom he was engaged, subject to
the emperor. As a mortal man, therefore,
Christ was subject to the emperor, although
of his own free will and voluntarily, just as of
his own free will too he was carried by the
devil to a mountain and even to Jerusalem
where he stood upon the pinnacle of the
temple.

Discipulus Adduxisti aliquas allegaciones ad
probandum quod Christus, in quantum homo
mortalis, fuit sub imperatore, quantum ad
iurisdictionem coactivam. Nunc nitere probare
hoc de apostolis.

Student You have adduced some arguments
to prove that, as a mortal man, Christ was
under the emperor, as far as his coercive
jurisdiction was concerned. Now try to prove
this of the apostles.

Magister Quod apostoli et omnes alii

Master It seems provable in many ways that
