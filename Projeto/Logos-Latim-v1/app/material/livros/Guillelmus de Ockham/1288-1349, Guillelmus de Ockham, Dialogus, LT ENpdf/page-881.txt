{oportet &NaMzPeRe} esse pontificem et quia
non decet eum verbo solo sed etiam
conversatione gubernare subiectos, et totius
{totus &Pe} populi {*om. &NaMzPeReZn}

Again, as we find in dist 63, c.
Valentinianus [c.3, col.235], we read about
that Valentinianus that when the bishops
had been called together for the election of
the bishop of Milan and blessed Ambrose
had been elected he spoke as follows, "You
know plainly, you who have been instructed
in divine eloquence, what kind of man a
bishop should be and that it is not fitting
that he govern those subject to him only by
his word but also by his way of life, and
that it is appropriate that he himself be an
imitator of every virtue and lead a good life
as a witness to his teaching. And so appoint
such a man in this episcopal see before
whom we who govern the empire may
sincerely lower our head and whose advice
we may receive of necessity, when we fail
as men do, as the remedy of one who
heals." After those words the following are
immediately added in the same place,
"When the emperor had said this, however,
the synod besought him that it should rather
be he who was to separate out a wise and
pious man." It seems that these words
clearly infer that according to the
declaration of that synod the emperor was
able to choose the bishop of Milan,
although he did not wish to do so. And so
he said to those bishops, "Such an election
falls on you." For because the emperor
refused to elect, the election pertained to
those bishops.
