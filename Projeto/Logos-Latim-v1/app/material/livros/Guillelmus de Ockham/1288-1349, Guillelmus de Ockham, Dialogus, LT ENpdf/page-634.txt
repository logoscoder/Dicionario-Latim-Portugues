&MzNaPe} imperator est dominus omnium
rerum quae spectant ad illos {ipsos &Pe} qui
sunt de imperio. Maior videtur nota
{*manifesta &MzNaPeRe}. Minor probatur per
illud quod legitur 2 {*1 &MzNaPeRe} Regum
8:[10-17] ubi sic habetur, "Dixit itaque Samuel
omnia verba Domini ad populum [...] et ait,
`Hoc erit ius regis qui imperaturus est {in add.
&Mz} vobis. Filios vestros tollet et ponet
{mittet &Pe} {monet &Mz} in curribus suis
facietque {*sibi add. &MzNaPeReVg} equites
et {in &Na} praecursores quadrigarum suarum
et constituet sibi tribunos et centuriones
[[quadrigarum ... centuriones: margin &Pe]] et
aratores agrorum suorum et messores segetum
et fabros armorum et curruum {cursuum
&MzPe} suorum. Filias quoque {filas quoque:
filiasque &Mz} vestras faciet sibi unguentarias
et sutarias {*focarias &NaReVg} et pannificas.
Agros quoque vestros et {om. &Na} vineas et
oliveta {et add. &Pe} optima tollet et dabit
servis suis. Sed et {om. &Pe} segetes vestras et
vinearum redditus addecimabit ut det eunuchis
{ethnicis &Pe} et famulis suis. Servos etiam
{om. &Pe} vestros et ancillas et iuvenes {om.
&Mz} [[gap left in ms]] vestros {*optimos
&MzNaPeReVg} et asinos auferet et ponet in
opere suo. Greges quoque vestros addecimabit,
vosque eritis ei {trs. &NaPeRe} servi." Ex
quibus {*verbis add. &MzNaPeRe} colligitur
quod omnia quae habebant pertinebant {om.
&Mz} ad ius regis et per consequens ad
dominium eius, praesertim cum sint servi eius
{*ipsius &MzNaRe} cum dicitur {*dicatur
&MzNaPeRe} expresse, "... vosque eritis ei
{trs. &NaPeRe} servi." Quicquid enim servus
habet domini sui {*om. &MzNaPeRe} est et
quicquid servus acquirit domino acquirit.
Amplius non minus sunt omnia de imperio
imperatoris quam antiquitus illa quae
pertinebant ad regna regum infidelium erant
eorum. Sed illa quae pertinebant ad regna
regum infidelium {*trs. &MzNaRe} erant

reported all the words of the Lord to the
people ... . He said, `These will be the ways
of the king who will reign over you. He
will take your sons and appoint them to his
chariots and to be his horsemen and to run
before his chariots; and he will appoint for
himself commanders of thousands and
commanders of fifties, and some to plough
his ground and to reap his harvest, and to
make his implements of war and the
equipment of his chariots. He will take your
daughters to be perfumers and cooks and
bakers. He will take the best of your fields
and vineyards and olive orchards and give
them to his courtiers. He will take one tenth
of your grain and of your vineyards and
give it to your officers and your courtiers.
He will take your best male and female
slaves, and the best of your young men and
donkeys and put them to his work. He will
take one tenth of your flocks, and you shall
be his slaves." We gather from these words
that everything which they had pertained to
the right of the king, and consequently to
his lordship, especially when they are his
slaves, since it expressly says, " ... and you
shall be his slaves." For whatever a slave
has is the lord's, and whatever a slave
acquires, he acquires for the lord.

Further, everything of the empire is no less
the emperor's than in former times those
things which pertained to the kingdoms of
unbelieving kings were theirs. But those
things which pertained to the kingdoms of
unbelieving kings were theirs. Therefore all
temporal things which pertain to the empire
and to those who are of the empire are the
emperor's. The major [premise] seems
