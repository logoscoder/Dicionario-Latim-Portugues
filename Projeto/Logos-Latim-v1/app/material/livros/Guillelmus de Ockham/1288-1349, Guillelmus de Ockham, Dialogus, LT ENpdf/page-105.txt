tantummodo veteres haereses imitantur, quamvis sint
pertinaces, non sunt haeretici reputandi. Et ita prior
descriptio haeretici non est congrue assignata quia
competit multis, scilicet illis qui tantummodo veteres
haereses imitantur, qui tamen non sunt haeretici
iudicandi secundum diffinitionem Augustini eo quod
novas opiniones neque gignunt nec sequuntur.

this definition that those who only imitate old heresies
should not be regarded as heretics even if they are
pertinacious. And so the earlier description of a
heretic was not suitably ascribed because it applies to
many people, namely those who only imitate old
heresies, who should nevertheless not be judged as
heretics according to Augustine's definition in that
they neither generate nor follow new opinions.

Item multi baptizati pertinaciter errant ex sola
credulitate vel deceptione non alicuius temporalis
commodi nec vanae gloriae nec principatus sui gratia.
Et per consequens secundum diffinitionem Augustini
non sunt haeretici iudicandi. Et tamen illis competit
descriptio saepe fata. Ergo non est vera descriptio.

Again, many who are baptised err pertinaciously only
because of credulity or deception, not for the sake of
any temporal advantage nor for the sake of vain glory
or their own rule. And, consequently, they should not
be judged as heretics according to Augustine's
definition. And yet that oft-cited description applies to
them. Therefore it is not a true description.

Item aliquis certus de fide et in nullo dubitans alicuius
temporalis commodi et maxime vanae gloriae
principatusque sui gratia contra conscientiam potest
novas ac falsas opiniones gignere atque sequi. Ergo
certus de fide et in nullo dubitans potest esse haereticus
secundum diffinitionem Augustini. Male ergo
describitur haereticus cum asseritur quod omnis
haereticus est pertinaciter dubitans vel errans contra
catholicam veritatem.

Again, someone certain about the faith who doubts
nothing can generate and follow new and false
opinions against his own conscience for the sake of
some temporal advantage and especially for the sake
of vain glory and his own rule. Therefore someone
who is certain about the faith and doubts nothing can
be a heretic according to Augustine's definition. A
heretic is badly described, therefore, when it is
asserted that every heretic doubts or errs
pertinaciously against catholic truth.

Magister Ad ista isti respondent dicentes quod
Augustinus non intendit in verbis praescriptis
haereticum diffinire sed intendit assignare unum
modum cognoscendi haereticum, ut scilicet quicunque
alicuius temporalis commodi et maxime vanae gloriae
principatusque sui gratia falsas ac novas opiniones
gignit vel sequitur censeatur haereticus. Unde licet in
propositione quam ponit Augustinus, si intelligatur
universaliter, primo ponatur vocaliter haereticus ante
copulam et ex hoc possit quis opinari quod haereticus
sit subiectum, tamen secundum rei veritatem, ut isti
dicunt, haereticus debet esse praedicatum et illud quod
sequitur debet esse subiectum. Et isto modo sub bono
intellectu concedenda est universalis formata ex verbis
Augustini ista, videlicet quicunque alicuius temporalis
commodi et maxime vanae gloriae principatusque sui
gratia animo pertinaciter defendendi novas ac falsas
opiniones contra fidem gignit vel sequitur est
reputandus haereticus, licet si contra conscientiam et in
corde de aliquo pertinente ad fidem nullatenus dubitans
praedicto modo haereses gigneret vel sequeretur non
esset apud Deum qui cor intuetur haereticus, quamvis
mortalissime coram Deo peccaret.

Master They reply to these by saying that Augustine
did not intend to define a heretic in the above words,
but intended to mark out one way of knowing a
heretic, that is that anyone who generates or follows
false and new opinions for the sake of some temporal
advantage and especially for the sake of vain glory
and his own rule is considered a heretic. Hence
although in the proposition which Augustine puts, if it
is understood universally, the word "heretic" is
verbally placed first before the copula, and someone
can form the opinion from this that "heretic" is the
subject, yet the truth of the matter is, they say, that
"heretic" ought to be the predicate and what follows
ought to be the subject. And in that way, under a
sound understanding, the following universal formed
from Augustine's words should be granted, that is,
anyone who generates or follows new and false
opinions against the faith for the sake of some
temporal advantage and especially for the sake of vain
glory and his own rule with the intention of defending
them pertinaciously should be regarded as a heretic,
although if he were to generate or follow heresies in
that way against his conscience, not doubting in his
heart anything pertaining to the faith, he would not be
a heretic before God, who sees his heart, though he
would sin most mortally in God's eyes.

Discipulus Quomodo debet quis reputari haereticus si
non est coram Deo haereticus?

Student How should someone be regarded as a
heretic if he is not a heretic in God's eyes?
