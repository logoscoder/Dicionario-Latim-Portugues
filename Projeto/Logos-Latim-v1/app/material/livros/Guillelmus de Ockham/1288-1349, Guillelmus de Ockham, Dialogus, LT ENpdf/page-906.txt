Discipulus Quia res de facili ad naturam suam

{om. &Pe} si Romani potestatem {pontificem

episcopi {pontificis &Pe} in summum
pontificem {pontifex &Mz} transtulerunt, an
{aut &Pe} in aliquo casu et in quo ius eligendi

14.4.1.1
14.4.1.1.1

Student Because things easily revert to their
nature, I have decided to ask you whether, if
the Romans have transferred to the supreme
pontiff the power of making arrangements
about the electors of the Roman bishop, in
any case, and in what case, the right to elect
and the power to make arrangements about
the electors of the pope reverts, according to
that opinion, to the Romans.

When does the right of election revert to the Romans?

Opinion 1: The right reverts to the Romans if the Pope and Cardinals are heretics

Magister Ad hoc diversimode respondetur.
Uno modo dicitur quod solummodo in uno
casu ius eligendi et potestas ordinandi de
electoribus revertitur {revertatur &Pe} ad
Romanos, puta si papa et electores omnes {fuit
add. &Pe} infecti fuerint {fuerunt &Re} {vel
essent &Pe} haeretica pravitate. {maculati add.
&Pe} Unde si papa et omnes cardinales
efficerentur haeretici et {om. &Pe} Romani
remanerent catholici, de fide et bono communi
in quantum spectaret ad ipsum {*ipsos
&NaPeRe} curam {*sollicitudinem &NaRe}
{om. &MzPe} [[ponere add. margin Pe]]
competentem habentes, eo ipso Romani
haberent ius eligendi et etiam {*om.
&NaPeRe} potestatem de electoribus
ordinandi. Si {sed &Pe} {*etiam add.
&NaPeRe} {et add. &Mz}, quando imperator
solus habuerit {*habuit &NaPeRe} ius
eligendi, {papam add. &Pe} [[interlinear]]

CHAPTER 8

Master Different replies can be made to this.
In one way it is said that in only one case
does the right to elect and the power to make
arrangements about electors revert to the
Romans, that is if the pope and all the
electors have been infected with heretical
wickedness. If, therefore, the pope and all the
cardinals were to become heretics and the
Romans were to remain catholic, having
suitable care for the faith and the common
good in so far as it pertained to them, by that
fact the Romans would have the right to elect
and the power to make arrangements about
electors. If the pope and the emperor had
become heretics when the emperor alone had
the right to elect, the Romans for that reason
would have recovered the right to elect and
the power to make arrangements about
electors.
