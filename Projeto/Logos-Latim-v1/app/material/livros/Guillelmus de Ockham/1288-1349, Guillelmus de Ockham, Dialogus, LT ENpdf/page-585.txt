{constat &Mz} {*trs. &MzNaPeRe} quod papa
qui pro tempore fuerit hoc tenet et approbat.
Dicunt enim {*autem &NaRe} quod haec {om.
&Na} haeresis pessima est quia secundum eam
posset papa {*trs. &MzNaPeRe} mutare totam
fidem et omnes articulos fidei et facere
articulos contrarios articulis contentis {*etiam
add. &NaRe} in Symbolo Apostolorum. Et ita
in tota fide Christiana {christianorum &Pe}
nihil esset certum et immutabile sed tota
{totum &Mz} dependeret {*penderet
&MzNaPeRe} ex voluntate papae. Et
evangelium et totam scripturam {*divinam add.
&MzNaPeRe} posset destruere et facere novam
scripturam contrariam {*trs.321 &MzNaPeRe}
cui omnes Christiani, quamdiu papa vellet,
adhaerere deberent, quam tamen {*postea
&MzNaPeRe} posset {*totam add.
&MzNaPeRe} mutare successor suus {*ipsius

Christianis novam legem {*fidem &MzNaRe}
quam pro tempore suo et quousque revocaretur
per successorem ipsam {*ipsius &MzNaPeRe}
tenerentur {teneretur &Na} accipere et

ex gestis temporis nostri, quarum una est quod
nullus Frater Minor, quantumcunque literatus et
doctus, debet amodo asserere nec approbare
quod mundus non fuit ab aeterno nec etiam
quod fuerit ab aeterno {nec etiam quod fuerit
ab aeterno om. &Pe}. Alia est quod nullus
Frater Minor deberet {*debet &MzNaRe}
approbare amodo quod in divinis sit aliqua
distinctio in personis. Alia est quod nullus
eorum debet {deberet &Pe} approbare quod
homo quantumcunque iustus non convertitur in
divinam essentiam, quemadmodum in {si &Pe}
sacramento altaris panis convertitur in corpus
Christi. Alia est quod nullus eorum debet
asserere amodo quod {*nec add. &MzNaRe}
beatus Petrus {Iohannes &Pe} nec aliquis alius
{*trs. &NaRe} homo qui non est Christus verus

anything pertaining to faith before he is
certain that the pope at the time holds and
approves it. They say moreover that this is
the worst heresy because according to it the
pope could change the whole faith and all
the articles of faith and could make articles
opposed even to the articles contained in
the Apostles' Creed. And so nothing would
be certain and unchangeable in the whole
of christian faith and all of it would depend
on the will of the pope. And he could
destroy the gospel and the whole of divine
scripture and could create a new opposed
scripture to which all christians would have
to adhere, as long as the pope wished it, all
of which afterwards his successor could
change. And so any pope could give
christians a new faith which they would be
bound to accept and approve during his
time and until it was revoked by his
successor. Nothing worse than this could be
said against the christian faith. They
conclude from the scriptures, moreover,
that additional absurdities follow from that
constitution. They say that many are
inferred from deeds of our own time, one of
which is that no Friar Minor, however
learned and skilled, should henceforth
assert or assent [to the proposition] that the
world has not existed since eternity, nor
even that it has existed since eternity.
Another is that no friar minor should
henceforth assent [to the proposition] that
there is any distinction among the persons
within the divine. Another is that none of
them should approve [the proposition] that
a man, however just, is not changed into the
divine essence, as in the sacrament of the
altar bread is changed into the body of
Christ. Another is that none of them should
assert henceforth that neither blessed Peter
nor any other man who is not Christ, true
God and true man, did not create the stars
and that without such a man God would not
know how to make anything. Another is
that none of them should henceforth assert
that the creatures of God are not pure
nothingness. That all these absurdities and
