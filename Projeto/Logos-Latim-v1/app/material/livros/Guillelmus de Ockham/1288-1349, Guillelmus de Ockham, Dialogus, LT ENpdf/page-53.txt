debent haereses reputari. Ex investigatis etiam circa
catholicas veritates sequi videtur quod omnis haeresis
sit damnata, quia, si omnis veritas catholica est per
ecclesiam approbata, videtur quod per eandem
ecclesiam omnis haeresis est damnata cum omnis
haeresis alicui veritati catholicae adversetur.
Approbato autem uno contrariorum constat aliud
reprobari et damnari. An ergo aliqui literati teneant
omnem haeresim esse damnatam nequaquam occultes.

with understanding which errors should be regarded
as heresies. It seems also to follow from what has
been investigated about catholic truths that every
heresy has been condemned because if every catholic
truth has been approved by the church it seems that
every heresy has been condemned by the same
church, since every heresy is opposed to some
catholic truth. When one of [two] contraries is
approved, however, it is certain that the other is
rejected and condemned. Therefore do not conceal
[from me] whether any learned men hold that every
heresy has been condemned.

Has every heresy been condemned already?
Magister Multi tenent et probare conantur quod omnis
haeresis est damnata. Hoc enim concilium generale sub
Innocentio 3 celebratum, de quo habetur Extra, De
haereticis, c. Excommunicamus, sentire videtur. Ait
enim, "Excommunicamus et anathematisamus omnem
haeresim, extollentem se adversus hanc sanctam,
catholicam et orthodoxam fidem quam superius
exposuimus." Ex quibus verbis patenter habetur quod
omnis haeresis est excommunicata et anathematisata, et
per consequens omnis haeresis est damnata.

Master Many hold and try to prove that every heresy
has been condemned. For the general council
celebrated under Innocent III, about which we read in
Extra, De hereticis, c. Excommunicamus [col.787],
seems to think this. For it says, "We excommunicate
and anathematise every heresy that exalts itself
against this holy, catholic and orthodox faith that we
expounded above." It is clearly established from these
words that every heresy has been excommunicated
and anathematised, and as a consequence every heresy
has been condemned.

Discipulus Ex hac auctoritate non videtur quod omnis
haeresis sit damnata sed solummodo quod omnis
haeresis extollens se adversus fidem quam supra
generale concilium exposuit in capitulo quod habetur
Extra, De summa trinitate et fide catholica, c. Firmiter,
sit damnata.

Student It does not seem from this text that every
heresy has been condemned, but only that every
heresy exalting itself against the faith that the general
council expounded earlier in the Chapter Firmiter
found in Extra, De summa trinitate et fide catholica
[col.5] has been condemned.

Magister Isti probant quod per dictum capitulum
Excommunicamus omnis haeresis simpliciter sit
damnata ex hoc ipso quod omnis haeresis extollens se
adversus fidem expositam in dicto capitulo Firmiter sit
damnata. Nam in dicto capitulo Firmiter tota fides
catholica approbatur. Ergo omnis haeresis simpliciter
per capitulum Excommunicamus quod damnat omnem
haeresim extollentem se adversus fidem quam exposuit
et approbavit in c. Firmiter reprobatur et damnatur.
Quod autem c. Firmiter approbet simpliciter totam
fidem catholicam patet expresse cum asserendo et
approbando dicat "Haec sancta Trinitas, secundum
communem essentiam individua et secundum
personales proprietates discreta, primo per Moysen et
sanctos prophetas aliosque famulos suos iuxta
ordinatissimam dispositionem temporum humano
generi doctrinam tribuit salutarem. Et tandem
unigenitus Dei filius Iesus Christus, a tota Trinitate
communiter incarnatus ex Maria semper virgine Spiritu
Sancto cooperante conceptus, verus homo factus, ex
anima rationali et humana carne compositus, una in
duabus naturis persona, viam vitae manifestius
demonstravit." Ex his verbis datur intelligi quod totam

Master They prove that every heresy has simply been
condemned by the said chapter Excommunicamus
from the fact that every heresy exalting itself against
the faith expounded in the said chapter Firmiter has
been condemned. For in that chapter Firmiter the
whole of catholic faith is approved. Therefore every
heresy is rejected and condemned simply by the
chapter Excommunicamus which condemns every
heresy that exalts itself against the faith that is
expounded and approved in the chapter Firmiter. That
the Chapter Firmiter approves simply the whole of
catholic faith is expressly clear since in its assertion
and approval it says: "This holy Trinity, individual
according to a common essence and distinct according
to their personal properties, has bestowed its salvific
teaching on the human race firstly through Moses, the
holy prophets and their other servants according to the
very well ordered arrangement of time. And at length
the only begotten son of God, Jesus Christ, made flesh
by the whole Trinity together, was conceived of Mary,
ever virgin, with the cooperation of the Holy Spirit,
became a true man, made up of a rational soul and
human flesh, one person with two natures, and very
