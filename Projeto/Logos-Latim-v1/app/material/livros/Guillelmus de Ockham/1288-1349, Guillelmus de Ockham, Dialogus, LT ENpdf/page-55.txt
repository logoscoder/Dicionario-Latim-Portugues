Secundus modus haeresum damnatarum explicite est
earum quarum contradictoriae sub forma propria
asseruntur seu approbantur, quia una contradictoriarum
approbata explicite, altera explicite intelligitur
reprobata. Tales sunt omnes haereses quae contradicunt
veritatibus catholicis quae in symbolis, conciliis
generalibus ac decretis et decretalibus epistolis
summorum
pontificum
tanquam
catholicae
approbantur. Unde ista haeresis, "Deus non est factor
omnium visibilium et invisibilium", est haeresis
explicite condemnata pro eo quod per symbolum,
"Credo in unum Deum", explicite approbatur Deum
esse factorem omnium visibilium et invisibilium.

The second mode of explicitly condemned heresies is
of those the contradictories of which have been
approved in that exact form, because with the explicit
approval of one of [two] contradictories the other is
understood to have been explicitly condemned. Of this
mode are all heresies which contradict the catholic
truths which are approved as catholic in the creeds, in
general councils and in decrees and decretal letters of
the highest pontiffs. Whence the heresy, "God is not
the maker of all things visible and invisible", is an
explicitly condemned heresy because through [the
article of] the creed, "I believe in one God", it is
explicitly approved that God is the maker of all things
visible and invisible.

Tertius est earum quarum contradictoriae in aliquo
volumine vel libro aut tractatu specialiter approbato
tanquam catholico sub forma propria continentur. Et
isto modo omnes haereses quarum contradictoriae in
canone Bibliae confirmato sub forma propria
continentur haereses damnatae explicite sunt
censendae, quia eo ipso quod canon Bibliae explicite
approbatur omnes veritates in ipso inserte explicite
approbantur, et per consequens earum contradictoriae
explicite reprobantur et damnantur.

The third [mode] consists of those the contradictories
of which are contained in that exact form in some
volume, book or tractate particularly approved as
catholic. And in that way all heresies the
contradictories of which are contained in that very
form in the confirmed canon of the bible should be
considered explicitly condemned heresies because by
the very fact that the canon of the bible is explicitly
approved all the truths inserted in it are explicitly
approved, and, as a consequence, their contradictories
are explicitly rejected and condemned.

Quartus est earum ex quibus patenter omnibus, etiam
laicis, usum habentibus rationis sequitur aliqua haeresis
sub aliquo trium modorum primorum comprehensa.

The fourth [mode] consists of those from which some
heresy included under any of the first three modes
follows in a way clear to everyone having the use of
reason, even laymen.

Discipulus Contra aliqua praedictorum possem dubia
multa movere, sed forsitan non essent multum ad rem
quia voces sunt ad placitum, et ideo possunt vocare
haereses damnatas explicite stricte et large sicut placet
eis dummodo hoc auctoribus non inveniatur expresse
contrarium. Idcirco dic quas haereses vocant damnatas
solum implicite.

Student I could raise many doubts about some of the
above, but perhaps they would not be much to the
point because words are a matter of opinion and so
they can call heresies explicitly condemned strictly or
broadly just as they please as long as this is not found
to be explicitly contrary to any [authoritative] writers.
Tell me therefore which heresies they say are
condemned only implicitly.

Magister Haereses de quibus solummodo viris literatis
in sacris literis eruditis per subtilem considerationem
patet quomodo catholicae veritati contentae in
Scripturis Sacris vel doctrina expressa universalis
ecclesiae adversantur et quod ex eis sequitur aliqua
haeresis aliquo praedictorum modorum damnata
explicite dicunt esse damnatas implicite et non
explicite. Talis haeresis fuit haeresis Graecorum
dicentium Spiritum Sanctum non procedere a Filio
antequam damnaretur explicite. Multae etiam haereses
de quibus habetur in decretis aliquando fuerunt
huiusmodi quae post explicite damnatae fuerunt. Tales
sunt haereses nonnullorum doctorum modernorum. Est
enim notorium quod moderni theologi circa divina
opiniones tenent contrarias quas putant in Scripturis
Divinis fundari, quarum altera in rei veritate Scripturae

Master They say that those heresies have been
condemned implicitly and not explicitly about which
it is clear only by subtle reflection to learned men
erudite in sacred letters how they are opposed to the
catholic truth contained in the sacred scriptures or in
the express teaching of the universal church and that
from them some heresy explicitly condemned in any
of the aforesaid modes follows. A heresy of this kind
was that of the Greeks when they were saying that the
Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son before that
was explicitly condemned. Many heresies also which
we find in the decretals were once of this kind, which
were afterwards condemned explicitly. The heresies
of some modern doctors are of this kind. For it is well
known that about divine matters modern theologians
hold opposing opinions which they believe to be
