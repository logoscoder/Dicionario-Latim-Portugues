to accuse Christ unless for a reason, (if, for
instance, they did not seem to be legitimate
accusers or they were rejected in some other
way by an accusation according to the laws)
because Christ gave power to accuse to those
wanting to accuse him. And consequently, by
virtue of that power given by Christ the
judges were superior to Christ, in so far as he
was a mortal man, and Christ was thus
inferior to them, although by his own free
will, just as also by his own free will he was
mortal and able to suffer.

And let these things suffice you for now.

Discipulus Quomodo probatur quod alii
poterant testificari contra Christum?
Magister Hoc asserit ipsemet Christus, ut
videtur {dicens add. &NaRe} [[crossed out
Re]] danti sibi alapam et male {*om. &NaRe}
dicenti, sic respondens pontifici, "Si male
locutus sum, testimonium perhibe {perhibere
&NaRe} de malo." Ioh. 18:[23] Hoc etiam
Gracianus sentire videtur, qui, ut legitur 2, q. 7,
para Ecce ostensum est, ait, "Christus,
quamvis esset pastor suorum {*suarum
&NaReZn} ovium, quas verbo et exemplo
pascebat, tamen quantum ad officiorum
distributionem, ex qua hodie in ecclesiis
{*ecclesia Zn} alii presunt aliis, unde quidam
prelati, quidam subditi vocantur, in populo illo
pastorale officium non gerebat. Mistica enim et
visibili unctione nec in regem nec in
sacerdotem unctus erat, que sole in illo populo
persone prelati veri {*prelati veri: prelature
&NaReZn} nomen sibi vendicabant." Ex
quibus verbis colligitur quod Christus, in
quantum homo mortalis, erat subditus illis qui
preerant {erant &Re} in populo illo.

Student How is it proved that others were
able to testify against Christ?

Master Christ himself asserts this, it seems,
to the one who struck his face and spoke to
him, speaking as follows to the priest, "If I
have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong."
(John 18:23) Gratian also seems to think this.
As we read in 2, q. 7, para Ecce ostensum est
[c.39, col.495], he says, "Although Christ
was the shepherd of his sheep, whom he fed
by teaching and example, yet he did not as far
as the distribution of offices was concerned
carry on a pastoral office among that people,
as a result of which [distribution] some
people are above others in the church today,
with some called prelates and some called
subjects. For he had not been anointed with a
mystic and visible anointing either as a king
or a priest, which persons alone laid claim to
the name of a prelature among that people."
We gather from these words that as a mortal
man Christ was subject to those who were in
command among that people.
