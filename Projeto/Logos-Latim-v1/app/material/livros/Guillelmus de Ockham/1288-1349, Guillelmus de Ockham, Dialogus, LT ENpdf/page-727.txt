the Roman empire, who committed the
lordship of these subjugated people to
whom they chose and who changed, as
and when they liked, the way of
dominating and ruling those who were
obedient to the Romans. But the Romans
did this in connection with the people
they had subjugated. We find this in 1
Maccabees 8:1, where we read as follows,
"Now Judas heard of the fame of the
Romans, that they were very strong. ...
And they (the Israelites) had heard of
their wars and the brave deeds that they
were doing among the Gauls, how they
had defeated them and forced them to pay
tribute, and what they had done in the
land of Spain to get control of the silver
and gold mines there, and how they had
gained control of the whole region by
their planning and patience, even though
the place was far distant from them. They
also crushed the kings who came against
them from the ends of the earth, and
inflicted a great disaster on them."

&MdMzNaPeRe} et obedientium eis cum {*cui

"{*Et add. &NaRe} in omnibus istis nemo

Moreover, that they committed to whom
they chose the lordship of the people they
had subjugated and who were obedient to
them is implied in the same place when it
says [1 Maccabees 8:14,16], "Yet for all
this not one of them has put on a crown or
worn purple as a mark of pride. ... They
trust one man each year to rule over them
and to control all their land; they all heed
the one man and there is no envy or
jealousy among them."
