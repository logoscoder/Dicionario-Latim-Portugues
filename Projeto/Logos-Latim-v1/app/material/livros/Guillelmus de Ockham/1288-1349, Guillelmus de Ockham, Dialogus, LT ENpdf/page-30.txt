pontificum, quando constat eos nihil contra fidem
diffinire catholicam, oportet certissime adhaerere. Sed
Romani pontifices multas veritates quae ex solo canone
confirmato probari non possunt diffiniunt firmiter esse
tenendas. Ergo de necessitate salutis oportet nonnullis
veritatibus quae ex solis Scripturis Divinis probari non
possunt fidem indubiam adhibere.

adhere most surely to the determinations and
definitions of the Roman pontiffs when it is certain
that they are defining nothing against catholic faith.
But the Roman pontiffs determine that many truths
which can not be proved from the confirmed canon
alone should be firmly held. Out of necessity for
salvation, therefore, it is proper to offer undoubting
faith to some truths which can not be proved solely
from the divine scriptures.

Discipulus Affecto scire an isti assertores ponant
exemplum de aliqua veritate quae firmiter sit tenenda
quae tamen nec in Scripturis Divinis habetur nec ex
solis Scripturis illis potest aperte probari.

Student I desire to know whether those who assert
this cite an example of some truth which should be
firmly held yet which is not found in the divine
scriptures and can not be clearly proved from those
scriptures alone.

Magister Multa exempla eorum iam tibi monstravi,
videlicet quod apostoli symbolum condiderunt, quod
beatus Petrus fuit Romanus episcopus pontifex, quod
sedes beati Petri de Antiochia translata fuit Romam,
quod beato Petro Romani episcopi successerunt. Aliud
etiam ponunt exemplum de primatu Romanae
ecclesiae, de quo in Divina Scriptura nulla fit mentio
quia, licet de primatu beati Petri Scriptura Sacra
expresse loquatur, quod tamen beatus Petrus Romanam
rexit ecclesiam in eadem Scriptura minime reperitur, et
ita de primatu Romanae ecclesiae nihil per solam
eandem Scripturam potest ostendi, et tamen firmiter
tenere debemus quod Romana ecclesia primatum habet
super alias ecclesias universas.

Master I have already shown you many of their
examples, namely that the apostles were the authors of
the creed, that blessed Peter was bishop of Rome, that
blessed Peter's see was transferred from Antioch to
Rome, and that the bishops of Rome succeeded
blessed Peter. They also cite another example,
concerning the primacy of the Roman church, of
which no mention is made in divine scripture because,
although sacred scripture speaks expressly about the
primacy of blessed Peter, it is nevertheless not found
in that scripture that blessed Peter ruled the Roman
church, and so nothing can be shown about the
primacy of the Roman church from that scripture
alone, and yet we ought to hold firmly that the Roman
church has primacy over all other churches.

Discipulus De isto primatu Romanae ecclesiae
supersede, quia de ipso postea aliquas quaestiones tibi
movebo. Sed si isti assertores in aliqua alia ratione se
fundant enarra.

Student Pass over the primacy of the church of Rome
because I will present you with some questions about
it later. But tell me if those who make this assertion
base themselves on any other argument.

Magister Adhuc aliis rationibus satagunt se munire.
Unde tertia ratio eorumdem est ista. Non in minori
reverentia et honore debet haberi apostolorum doctrina
quam eorum canones et statuta; sed canones et statuta
apostolorum, sive ea in scriptis redegerint sive solo
verbo ipsa servari mandaverint, firmiter sunt servanda;
ergo et omnes veritates quas scripto vel verbo apostoli
docuerunt tanquam verissime sunt habendae. Apostoli
autem quamplurima docuerunt quae in scriptis minime
reliquerunt; ergo aliquae veritates quae in scripturis
canonicis non habentur verissimae sunt censendae,
quibus per consequens oportet adhaesione certissima
consentire.

Master They try to fortify themselves with still other
arguments. Their third argument is this. The teaching
of the apostles should not be held in less reverence
and honour than their canons and statutes; but the
canons and statutes of the apostles, either those they
collected in their writings or those they only orally
ordered to be preserved, should be firmly preserved;
therefore all the truths which the apostles taught in
writing or orally should be considered as absolutely
true. However, the apostles taught very many things
which they did not leave in their writings; therefore
some truths which are not found in the canonical
scriptures should be considered absolutely true.
Consequently, it is necessary to agree with these and
to adhere most surely to them.

Quarta ratio eorum est haec. Universalis ecclesia non
potest errare, ipsa veritate testante quae ait apostolis
Matthaei ultimo, "Vobiscum sum usque ad
consummationem seculi." Quae etiam pro fide Petri

A fourth argument of theirs is this. The universal
church can not err, as the Truth himself attests when
he says to the apostles in the last chapter of Matthew
[28:20], "I am with you always, to the end of the age."
