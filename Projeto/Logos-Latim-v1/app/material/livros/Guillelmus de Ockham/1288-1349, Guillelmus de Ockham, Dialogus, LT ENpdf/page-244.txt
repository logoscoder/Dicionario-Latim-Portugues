Magister Dicunt quod in tali casu nichil restaret pape
nisi vel aliud concilium generale convocare, si posset,
vel per potenciam se tueri, vel, omni humano deficiente,
consilio et auxilio se gracie divine committere et
pacienter illatam iniuriam tollerare.

Master: They say that in such a case nothing would
remain for the pope except either to convoke another
general council, if he were able to do so, or to protect
himself by force or, if all human counsel and help
were to fail, to commit himself to divine grace and
endure patiently the injury inflicted on him.

Ad secundam racionem dicitur quod licet iudicium
multis modis accipiatur, ad presens tamen sufficiat duos
modos exponere. Est itaque iudicium certe et veridice
cognicionis quo unusquisque bene iudicat de illo quod
noscit. Et istud iudicium pertinet ad quemlibet in
quacumque arte peritum. Est aliud iudicium auctoritatis
sive iudicialis sentencie. Primo modo loquendo de
iudicio, in ecclesia militante est certum iudicium
quantum ad ea que necesse est credere explicite ad
salutem consequendam eternam, quia semper usque ad
finem mundi erunt aliqui catholici qui circa talia in vera
fide explicita permanebunt. Sed circa illa que non est
necesse explicite credere non est necessarium quod
semper in ecclesia militante sit tale iudicium, quia multa
sunt de quibus melius est pie dubitare quam unam
partem contradiccionis vel aliam temere diffinire.
Numquam tamen circa quecumque talia omnes
Christiani neque pertinaciter errabunt neque pertinaciter
dubitabunt, sed semper erunt aliqui in ecclesia qui circa
huiusmodi loco et tempore oportunis querent cauta
sollicitudine veritatem, parati tenere eciam explicite si
eam invenerint, sive per propriam meditacionem, sive
per occasionem acceptam a scripturis, sive aliis
hominibus
quibuscumque,
sive
per
divinam
revelacionem. Et ideo numquam omnes in hereticam
incident pravitatem. Iudicium vero auctoritatis sive
iudicialis sentencie non oportet quod semper sit certum
in ecclesia militante; ymmo potest aliquando deficere
et, ut videtur, aliquando defecit. Tempore enim Liberii
pape, qui postquam consenserat perfidie Ariane tenuit
papatum 6 annis, verum iudicium auctoritatis et
iudicialis sentencie nullum fuit de hiis que pertinebant
ad fidem. Ante tempora eciam Constantini tale iudicium
de hiis que fidei sunt defecisse videtur, quia, teste
Isidoro, ut habetur dist. 15, c. 1, illis temporibus
Christianitas in diversas hereses scissa fuit quia non erat
catholicis facultas conveniendi in unum.

To the second argument it is said that although
'judgement' is taken in many ways it is sufficient for
the moment to expound two of them. And so there is
a judgement of sure and truthful knowledge by which
anyone judges well of what he knows. And a
judgement of that kind pertains to anyone skilled in
any art. There is another judgement of authority or
judicial opinion. Speaking of judgement in the first
way, there is in the church militant certain judgement
with respect to what it is necessary to believe
explicitly in order to attain eternal salvation, because
until the end of the world there will always be some
catholics whose faith will remain explicitly true
about such matters. But it is not necessary that there
always be in the church militant such judgement
about those things which it is not necessary to believe
explicitly, because there are many things about which
it is better to doubt piously than to define rashly one
or the other part of a contradiction. Nevertheless
about all such matters it will never be the case that all
Christians will either err pertinaciously or doubt
pertinaciously, but there will always be some in the
church who at an appropriate time and place will
seek the truth about such matters with diligent care,
prepared too to hold it explicitly if they find it,
whether through their own meditation or through an
opportunity provided by the scriptures or by any
other men or though divine revelation. And therefore
it will never happen that all will fall into heretical
wickedness. But it is not necessary that the
judgement by authority or judicial opinion in the
church militant be always certain; on the contrary it
can sometimes fail and, it seems, sometimes has
failed. For in the time of Pope Liberius, who held the
papacy for six years after he had approved the Arian
perfidy, there was no true judgement by authority and
judicial opinion about those things that pertained to
faith. Before the time of Constantine too judgement
of that kind about matters of faith seems to have
failed because, as Isidore attests in dist. 15, c. 1
[col.34], in those days Christianity was divided into
various heresies because catholics had no power to
meet as one.

Discipulus Isidorus dicit ibi quod episcopis non erat
facultas conveniendi in unum, et ideo in diversas
hereses Christianitas scissa est. Ex quo datur intelligi
quod si tunc fuisset facultas conveniendi ad concilium
generale Christianitas in diversas hereses scissa non
fuisset. Et ita videtur quod concilium generale contra
fidem errare non possit.

Student: Isidore says there that bishops had no
power to come together as one, and therefore
Christianity was divided into various heresies. We
are given to understand by this that if there had been
power at the time for convening a general council
Christianity would not have been divided into various
heresies. And so it seems that a general council can
