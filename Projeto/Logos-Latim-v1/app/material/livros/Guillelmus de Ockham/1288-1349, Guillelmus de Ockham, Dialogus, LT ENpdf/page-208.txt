principatum aut primatum potestati beati Petri seu
primatui receperunt a Christo, quia par super parem
nullum noscitur primatum habere. Apostoli autem
potestatem equalem potestati beati Petri receperunt a
Christo. Hanc auctoritatibus Sacre Scripture et
sanctorum moliuntur ostendere. Primo autem hanc
declarare nituntur auctoritate Christi dicentis cunctis
apostolis Matthei 18 c., "Amen dico vobis quecumque
ligaveritis super terram erunt ligata et in celo." Ex quibus
verbis dicunt manifeste patere quod potestas ligandi et
solvendi equalis potestati Petri fuit data apostolis a
Christo. Beatus autem Petrus non aliam potestatem in
qua dicatur excellere alios recepit a Christo nisi
potestatem ligandi et solvendi; ergo beatus Petrus et
omnes alii apostoli equalem potestatem habuerunt a
Christo. Hoc eciam Iohannes Evangelista recitans verba
Salvatoris videtur asserere 20 c. dicens, "Dixit ergo eis
iterum, 'Pax vobis. Sicut misit me pater et ego mitto vos.'
Hec cum dixisset insufflavit et dixit eis, 'Accipite
Spiritum Sanctum: quorum remiseritis peccata
remittuntur eis et quorum retinueritis retenta sunt.'" Ex
quibus verbis datur intelligi quod Christus claves regni
celorum quas promiserat beato Petro tunc dedit omnibus
apostolis, et ita in persona beati Petri cum dixit, "Tibi
dabo claves regni celorum', omnibus apostolis promisit
claves regni celorum. Quare cum claves promisse et
postea date beato Petro eius potestatem designent,
sequitur quod alii apostoli equalem potestatem cum
beato Petro receperunt a Christo, et ita Petrus potestatem
seu principatum aut primatum super alios apostolos a
Christo non habuit.

received from Christ power, rule or primacy equal to
the power or primacy of blessed Peter, because an
equal is known to have no primacy over an equal.
However the apostles received from Christ power
equal to blessed Peter's power. They try to show this
by texts [taken from] sacred scripture and the saints.
They try to make this clear first on the authority of
Christ's saying to all the apostles at Matthew
18[:18], "Amen, I say to you, whatsoever you shall
bind upon earth shall be bound also in heaven."
They say that it is quite clear from these words that
a power of binding and loosing equal to Peter's
power was given to the apostles by Christ. Blessed
Peter received from Christ, however, no other power
in which he may be said to excel the others except
the power of binding and loosing. Blessed Peter and
all the other apostles, therefore, obtained equal
power from Christ. John the evangelist seems to
affirm this too when he reports the Saviour as saying
in chapter 20[:21-3], "[Jesus] said therefore to them
again, 'Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me,
I also send you.' When he had said this, he breathed
on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.
Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven
them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are
retained.'" We are given to understand by these
words that the keys of the kingdom of heaven which
Christ had promised to blessed Peter he gave at that
time to all the apostles and so when he said [Matt.
16:19], "I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom
of heaven", he promised the keys of the kingdom of
heaven to all the apostles in the person of blessed
Peter. Wherefore, since the keys promised and later
given to blessed Peter designate his power it follows
that the other apostles received from Christ power
equal to that of blessed Peter; and so Peter did not
obtain from Christ power, rule or primacy over the
other apostles.

Amplius, recipere potestatem super alios quam non debet
in eos recipiens exercere est superfluum, vanum et
inutile reputandum; in operibus autem Christi nichil
superfluum, vanum vel inutile potest reperiri. Christus
autem non dedit beato Petro aliquam potestatem super
alios apostolos quam in eos non debuit exercere; ymmo
talem potestatem beato Petro et omnibus aliis apostolis
super apostolos interdixit, dicens Matthei 20, "Scitis
quod principes gencium dominantur eorum et qui
maiores sunt potestatem exercent in eos. Non ita erit
inter vos." Et Marci 10 ita legitur, "Iesus autem vocans
eos ait illis, 'Scitis quod hi qui videntur principari
gentibus dominantur eis et principes eorum potestatem
habent ipsorum. Non ita autem est in vobis." Et Luce 22
c. refert verba Christi dicentis, "Reges gencium
dominantur eorum et qui potestatem habent super eos
benefici vocantur, vos autem non sic." Ex quibus verbis
datur intelligi quod nullus apostolus debuit in alios
potestatem exercere; ergo nec beatus Petrus habuit a

In addition, it should be regarded as unnecessary,
vain and useless for someone to receive power over
others which he ought not exercise over them.
However, nothing unnecessary, vain or useless can
be found among the works of Christ. Now Christ did
not give blessed Peter any power over the other
apostles that Peter ought not to have exercised over
them. On the contrary he forbad such power over the
apostles to blessed Peter and to all the other
apostles, saying at Matt. 20[:25-6], "You know that
the princes of the gentiles lord it over them and they
that are the greater exercise power over them. It
shall not be so among you." We read the following
too at Mark 10[:42-3], "But Jesus calling them said
to them, 'You know that they who seem to rule over
the gentiles lord it over them, and their princes have
power over them. But it is not so among you.'" Luke
22[:25-6] also reports Christ as saying, "The kings
of the gentiles lord it over them; and they that have
