Tertia ratio est haec. Qui inique opiniones haereticales
et impias sapit est pertinax reputandus quia absque
pertinacia nemo opiniones impias inique sapit. Qui
enim absque pertinacia sapit opiniones impias quamvis
sapiat impia non tamen impia inique sapit. Sed errans
contra fidem catholicam qui de veritate renuit informari
inique impia sapit, teste Leone papa qui ut habetur 24.
q. 3. c. Quid autem iniquius ait, "Quid autem iniquius
est quam impia sapere et sapientibus doctoribusque non
credere. Sed in hanc insipientiam cadunt qui cum ad
cognoscendam veritatem aliquo impediuntur obscuro
non ad propheticas voces, non ad apostolicas literas, nec
ad evangelicas auctoritates, sed ad semetipsos
recurrunt." Ex his verbis colligitur quod qui impia sapit
et non credit sapientibus nec ad scripturas recurrit
autenticas iniquissimus est censendus. Sed qui de
veritate renuit informari non credit sapientibus nec ad
scripturas recurrit autenticas. Ergo talis iniquissimus et
per consequens pertinax est censendus.

The third argument is this. He who wickedly savours
heretical and impious opinions should be regarded as
pertinacious because no one wickedly savours impious
opinions without pertinacity. For he who savours
impious opinions without pertinacity does not savour
impious matters wickedly, although he does savour
them. But he who errs against the catholic faith and
refuses to be instructed about the truth wickedly
savours impious matters, as Pope Leo attests when he
says, as we find in 24, q. 3, [c.30] Quid autem iniquius,
"What is more wicked than to savour impious matters
and not to believe those who are wise and more
learned? But it is into this madness that they fall who,
when they are prevented by some obscurity from
learning the truth, have recourse not to prophetic
words, nor to apostolic writings, nor to the gospel texts,
but to themselves." [col.1429] We gather from these
words that he who savours impious matters and neither
believes the wise nor has recourse to the scriptures
should be considered most wicked. But he who refuses
to be instructed about the truth neither believes the
wise nor has recourse to authentic scriptures. Such a
person should be considered, therefore, most wicked
and, consequently, pertinacious.

Quarta ratio est haec Qui ideo magister erroris existit
quia non vult esse discipulus veritatis est pertinax
reputandus. In tali enim ultra ignorantiam intellectus in
voluntate malitia invenitur. Ista autem malitia voluntatis
vel est pertinacia vel non est sine pertinacia. Sed errans
qui cum potest et debet de veritate renuit informari ideo
magister erroris existit quia non vult esse discipulus
veritatis. Qui enim non vult audire veritatem non vult
esse discipulus veritatis. Ergo talis pertinax est
censendus.

The fourth argument is this. He who, because he does
not want to be a disciple of truth, is as a result a master
of error should be regarded as pertinacious. For in
addition to ignorance of understanding a wickedness of
will is found in such a person. That wickedness of will,
however, either is pertinacity or is not without
pertinacity. But an errant who refuses to be instructed
about the truth when he can and should be is a master
of error because he does not want to be a student of
truth. For he who does not want to hear the truth does
not want to be a disciple of truth. Such a person should,
therefore, be considered pertinacious.

(Fr reads:
Quarta ratio est haec. Omnis errans qui cum potest et
debet renuit informari de veritate est non volens audire
veritatem et omnis non volens audire veritatem non est
discipulus veritatis. Omnis vero non discipulus veritatis
est magister erroris, per decretum positum in ratione
tertia precedente immediate et 2. q. 7. Nos. Sed si omnis
magister erroris est pertinax et hereticus censendus,
ergo de primo ad ultimum omnis errans contra fidem
qui cum debet et potest renuit informari de veritate
pertinax est et hereticus censendus. Consequentia pro
tanto valet in proposito quia ex ea formari possunt
plures formae syllogistice in barbara evidentes, iuxta
numerum mediorum.

(Fr has a different fourth argument:
The fourth argument is this. Every errant who refuses
to be instructed about the truth when he can and should
be is someone who does not want to hear the truth; and
every one who does not want to hear the truth is not a
disciple of truth. Now everyone who is not a disciple of
truth is a master of error, from the decretal cited in the
immediately preceding third argument and from 2, q. 7,
[c.41] Nos. [cols.702-3] But if every master of error
should be considered pertinacious and heretical then
[considering every step] from the first to the last every
errant against the faith who refuses to be instructed
about the truth when he ought to be and can be, should
be considered pertinacious and heretical. In the present
case the consequence is valid as far as it goes, since
from it can be formed many evident syllogistic forms
in "barbara", depending on the number of middle
