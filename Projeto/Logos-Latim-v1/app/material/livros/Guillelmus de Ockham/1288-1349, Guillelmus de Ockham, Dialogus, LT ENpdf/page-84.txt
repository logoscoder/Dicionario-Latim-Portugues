ulla dubitatione credendo.

that pertain to the orthodox faith.

Discipulus Quid est credere aliquid implicite?

Disciple What is it to believe something implicitly?

Magister Respondetur quod credere implicite est alicui
universali ex quo multa sequuntur firmiter assentire et
nulli contrario pertinaciter adhaerere, et ideo qui
firmiter tenet omnia tradita in Scriptura Divina et
doctrina universalis ecclesiae esse vera et sana, et non
adhaeret pertinaciter alicui assertioni veritati contrariae
orthodoxae, fidem catholicam inviolatam tenet et
integram et catholicus est censendus.

Master It is answered that to believe implicitly is to
assent firmly to some universal [statement] from which
many things follow and not adhere pertinaciously to
anything contrary, and therefore whoever firmly holds
that everything handed down in divine scripture and the
teaching of the universal church is true and sound and
does not adhere pertinaciously to any assertion contrary
to orthodox truth holds the Catholic faith inviolate and
whole and should be considered a Catholic.

Discipulus Videtur quod sufficiat credere omnia quae
tradit universalis ecclesia esse vera ad hoc quod aliquis
sit reputandus catholicus, et ita superflue additur quod
nulli contrario pertinaciter adhereat.

Disciple It seems that for someone to be regarded as a
Catholic it would be enough to believe that all things
that the universal church hands down are true, and thus
it is superfluous to add that he should not adhere
pertinaciously to anything contrary.

Magister Dicunt literati nonnulli quod non sufficit
credere omnia esse vera quae universalis tradit ecclesia
nisi simul cum hoc nulli contrario in particulari
pertinaciter adhaereatur. Multi enim sunt haeretici
condempnati per concilia generalia qui tamen firmiter
tenuerunt omnia tradita in Scriptura Sacra esse vera;
quia tamen pertinaciter adhaeserunt alicui assertioni in
rei veritate contrariae assertioni Scripturae Divinae
(quamvis hoc non viderent), non fuerunt catholici sed
haeretici iudicati.

Master Some of the learned say that it is not enough to
believe that all things that the universal church hands
down are true, unless together with this nothing
contrary is adhered to pertinaciously in particular. For
many heretics have been condemned by general
councils who nevertheless firmly held that all things
handed down in sacred scripture are true; however,
because they adhered pertinaciously to some assertion
in truth contrary to an assertion of divine scripture
(although they did not see this), they were judged to be
not Catholics but heretics.

Discipulus Apparet mihi quod non potest perfecte
cognosci quis est reputandus catholicus nisi sciatur quis
est haereticus iudicandus. Et ideo ad quaerendum de
haereticis me convertam. Dic tamen prius qualiter
declaratur quod aliquis potest credere quod omnia quae
continet Scriptura Divina vel ecclesia universalis sunt
vera et tamen pertinaciter adherere alicui assertioni
quae contrariatur alicui veritati quae in Scriptura Sacra
vel doctrina universalis ecclesiae continetur.

Disciple It seems to me not possible to know perfectly
who is to be regarded as a Catholic unless one knows
who is to be judged a heretic, and therefore I will turn
to the inquiry concerning heretics. But say first how it
is explained that someone can believe that all things
that divine scripture contains, or the [doctrine of the]
universal church, are true, and yet adhere
pertinaciously to some assertion opposed to some truth
contained in sacred scripture or in the teaching of the
universal church.

Magister Hoc declaratur sic. Sicut contingit aliquid
scire in universali et ignorare in particulari, secundum
sententiam sapientis, quod non est aliud quam scire
propositionem universalem et ignorare aliquam eius
singularem (sicut possum scire quod omnis homo est
rationalis ignorando hanc singularem, "Iste est
rationalis", demonstrato aliquo quem video a remotis de
quo ignoro an sit homo vel animal brutum), ita contingit
scire aliquam universalem et putare aliquam eius
singularem esse falsam (sicut possum scire quod omnis
homo est risibilis et tamen, demonstrato aliquo homine
quem video a remotis quem puto esse asinum vel aliud
animal, sicut saepe contingit, possum credere quod iste
non est risibilis quia puto quod iste non est homo): sic
possibile est quod aliquis credat hanc universalem,
"Omnia contenta in Scriptura Divina sunt catholica et
vera", et tamen credat hanc esse falsam, "Beatus
Andreas fuit apostolus Christi", quia ignorat hanc

Master This is explained as follows. Just as it is
possible to know something in a universal [statement]
and not know it in particular (according to the opinion
of the wise man), which is simply to know the
universal proposition and not know one of its singulars
(for example, I can know that every man is rational, not
knowing the singular, "This is rational", when some
man is pointed out whom I see from a distance and do
not know whether he is a man or a brute animal), so it
is possible to know some universal and think that one
of its singulars is false (for example, I can know that
every man is capable of laughter, and yet, when some
man is pointed out whom I see from a distance and
think to be an ass or some other animal, as often
happens, I can believe that he is not capable of
laughter, because I think that he is not a man) -- so it is
possible for someone to believe the universal
statement, "All things contained in divine scripture are
