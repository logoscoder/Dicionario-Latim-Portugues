Ad auctoritatem autem Nicolai pape dicitur quod
Nicolaus loquitur de ecclesia Romana que est papa, quia
illi soli ecclesie Romane que est papa in beato Petro
immediate a Christo fuit traditum privilegium. Illa
autem ecclesia Romana que est subiecta Pape nullum
privilegium habet nisi a papa, quod papa potest, quando
sibi placet, auferre. Vult ergo Nicolaus papa asserere
quod qui Romane ecclesie que est papa privilegium
conatur auferre, asserendo videlicet ipsum non esse
prelatum omnium Christianorum, hereticus est, quia
incidit in assercionem erroneam que sapit heresim
manifestam, quia ex ipsa et quibusdam veris que nulla
possunt tergiversacione negari sequitur heresis
manifesta quod beatus Petrus non fuit a Christo
omnibus prelatus fidelibus. Et ideo illi qui dicunt quod
papa non potest transferre sedem papalem de Roma
dicunt quod talis sic nitens auferre privilegium Romane
ecclesie que est papa est hereticus, stricte sumpto
heretico. Qui autem dicunt quod papa potest transferre
sedem dicunt quod est hereticus large sumpto heretico,
secundum quod aliquis dicitur hereticus qui pertinaciter
tenet assercionem que non est heresis stricte sumpta
heresi sed est heresis secundum quod omnis assercio
sapiens heresim manifestam heresis appellatur. Qualiter
autem tales asserciones distinguantur ex superioribus
ubi tactum est de heresibus patere potest.

To the text from Pope Nicholas, however, it is said
that Nicholas is speaking of the Roman church that is
the pope, because only to that Roman church that is
the pope, in the person of blessed Peter, was that
privilege directly handed over by Christ. That Roman
church which is subject to the pope, however, has no
privilege except from the pope and the pope can take
it away whenever it pleases him. Pope Nicholas
wants to affirm, therefore, that whoever tries to take
away the privilege of the Roman church that is the
pope, by asserting, that is, that he was not set above
all Christians, is a heretic because he has fallen into
an erroneous assertion which smacks of manifest
heresy since from it and certain truths which can not
be denied without subterfuge follows the manifest
heresy that blessed Peter was not set by Christ above
all believers. And therefore those who say that the
pope can not transfer the papal see from Rome are
saying that someone striving in this way to take away
the privilege of the Roman church which is the pope
is a heretic, taking the word 'heretic' strictly. Those
who say that the pope can transfer his see, however,
are saying that [such a person] is a heretic, taking the
word 'heretic' broadly in the sense that someone is
called a heretic who pertinaciously maintains an
assertion which is not a heresy with the word 'heresy'
taken strictly but is a heresy in the sense that any
assertion which smacks of manifest heresy is called a
heresy. How such assertions are distinguished,
however, is evident from earlier remarks where
heresies were touched on.

Ad racionem terciam respondetur quod sine Romana
ecclesia que est subiecta pape et que non est papa posset
regi universalis ecclesia.

It is replied to the third argument that the universal
church could be ruled without the Roman church
which is subject to the pope and which is not the
pope.

Ad auctoritatem autem beati Anacleti respondetur quod
apostolicam sedem vocat summum pontificem quia
summus pontifex, sive sit Rome sive Esculi, est caput et
cardo quo omnes ecclesie, Domino disponente,
reguntur, quando est verus papa. Hec tamen ecclesia
contra fidem errare potest quia papa potest incurrere
hereticam pravitatem. Sed tunc substituendus est ei
alius catholicus qui ecclesiam regat catholicam, sive
fuerit in Ytalia, sive in Gallia, sive in Yspania, sive
Germania.

The reply to the text from blessed Anacletus is that
he calls the apostolic see the highest pontiff because
the highest pontiff, when he is a true pope, whether
he is at Rome or at Ascoli, is the head and hinge by
which all churches, with the Lord arranging matters,
are ruled. Nevertheless this church can err against
faith because the pope can fall into heretical
wickedness. But then another catholic should be
substituted for him who will rule the catholic church
whether he be in Italy, in France, in Spain or in
Germany.

Ad quartam racionem dicitur quod hec est falsa: illa
ecclesia non potest errare contra fidem a qua quicumque
dissentit non est inter catholicos episcopos numerandus.
Sed illa de inesse est vera. Illa ecclesia non errat contra
fidem a qua quicumque dissentit, etc. Et ideo quamdiu
Romana ecclesia non errat contra fidem quicumque
dissentit ab ea in fide non est inter catholicos
computandus; sed si erraret contra fidem non haberet

It is said to the fourth argument that this is false,
namely, that the church from which anyone who
dissents should no longer be numbered among
catholic bishops can not err against faith. But this is
true as a factual statement: the church from which
anyone who dissents, etc., does not err against faith.
And therefore as long as the Roman church does not
err against faith whoever dissents from it in faith
