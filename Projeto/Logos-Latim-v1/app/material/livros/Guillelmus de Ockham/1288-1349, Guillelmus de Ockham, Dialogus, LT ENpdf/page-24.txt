epistola ad Hieronymum et recitatur etiam in decretis,
dist. 9, c. Ego, ait, "Ego solis eis scriptorum, qui iam
canonici appellantur, didici hunc timorem honoremque
referre ut eorum nullum scribendo errasse audeam
credere ac si aliquid in eis offendero, quod videatur
contrarium veritati, nihil aliud quam vel mendosum
esse codicem esse vel non esse assecutum interpretem
quod dictum est vel minime me intellexisse non
ambigam. Alios autem ita lego ut quantalibet sanctitate
quantave doctrina polleant non ideo verum putem quia
ita ipsi senserunt sed quia mihi per alios auctores vel
canonicas vel probabiles rationes quod a vero non
abhorreat persuadere potuerunt." Ex his verbis
colligitur quod solis libris canonicis qui in biblia
continentur necesse est fidem certissimam adhibere et
quod assertionibus aliorum non est necessarium ad
salutem firmiter adhaerere.

recorded also in the decretals, dist. 9, c. Ego [c. 5,
col.17], Augustine says, "I have learnt to offer this
fear and honour only to those works of writers who
are now called canonical, so that I dare to believe that
none of them has erred in writing; and I do not doubt
that if I come upon anything in them which seems
contrary to the truth it is nothing but either a faulty
codex or that the expounder has not comprehended
what has been said or that I have not understood it. I
read other [writers], however, in such a way that
however greatly enriched they are in sanctity or
learning I do not as a result think something true
because they have believed it to be so but because
they have been able to persuade me by other authors
or by canonical or probable arguments that it is not
inconsistent with the truth." We gather from these
words that it is necessary to offer the most certain
trust only to those canonical books which are
contained in the bible and that it is not necessary to
salvation to cling firmly to the assertions of other
[books].

Item hoc idem Augustinus in libro, De unico Baptismo,
ut recitatur eadem dist. 9, c. Quis nesciat, aperte sentire
videtur. Ait enim, "Quis nesciat Sanctam Scripturam
canonicam tam veteris quam novi testamenti certis
terminis suis contineri, eamque posterioribus omnibus
episcoporum litteris ita praeponi ut de illa omnino
dubitari et disceptari non possit, utrum verum vel
utrum rectum sit, quicquid in ea scriptum esse
constiterit? Episcoporum autem litteras quae post
confirmatum canonem vel scriptae sunt vel scribentur
et per sermonem forte sapientiorem cuiuslibet in ea re
peritioris et per aliorum episcoporum graviorem
auctoritatem doctioremque prudentiam et per concilia
licere reprehendi licere si quid in eis forte a veritate est
deviatum?" Ex his verbis colligitur quod de sola
scriptura Novi et Veteris Testamenti est illicitum
dubitare utrum sit verum vel rectum quicquid in ea
scriptum esse constiterit. Ergo de omnibus scripturis
generalium conciliorum et quorumcunque aliorum
expositorum Scripturae Divinae ac etiam Romanorum
pontificum et quorumlibet historiographorum post
canonem editis confirmatum non est illicitum dubitare
et disceptare an a veritate exorbitent quaecunque
scripta in eis constiterint in eis antequam Scripturae
Sacrae novi et veteris testamenti consona
demonstrentur.

Again, Augustine seems clearly to believe this in his
book, De unico baptismo, as recorded in the same dist.
9, c. Quis nesciat [c. 8, col. 17]. For he says, "Who
does not know that holy canonical scripture, both of
the Old and the New Testament, contains its own
fixed limits and that it is so preferred to all the later
letters of bishops that there can not be any doubt or
dispute about it at all, about whether whatever has
been written in it is true or right? [Who does not
know], however, that if there is anything in the letters
of bishops, which have been written or will be written
after the canon was confirmed, that has by chance
deviated from the truth, it is permissible for them to
be reproved by the perhaps wiser discourse of anyone
more expert in the matter at hand and by the weightier
authority and more learned prudence of other bishops
and by councils?" We gather from these words that
only about Scripture in the New and Old Testament is
it impermissible to doubt whether whatever has been
written in it is true or right. About all that has been
written and published after the confirmation of the
canon, therefore, whether by general councils, by any
other expositors of divine scripture, even by Roman
pontiffs and by any historians at all it is not
impermissible to doubt and discuss, before they are
shown to be in accord with the New and Old
Testament of sacred scripture, whether anything
written in them deviates from the truth.

Item Augustinus in epistola ad Vincentium et allegatur
dist. praedicta c. Noli, loquens de scripturis
posterioribus novo et veteri testamento, ait, "Hoc genus
literarum ab auctoritate canonis distinguendum est; non
enim sic leguntur tanquam ex eis ita testimonium
proferatur ut contra sentire non liceat, sicubi forte aliter
sapuerint quam veritas postulat." Ex his habetur quod

Again, speaking about writings later than the New and
Old Testament in a letter to Vincent cited in the same
distinction [9], c. Noli [c. 9, col. 18], Augustine says,
"This sort of writing should be distinguished from the
authority of the canon; for we do not read them as
though the evidence put forward from them is such
that it is not permissible to think the contrary, if by
