concludere, quia {quod &Na} secundum istum
modum nec aliquis deberet {debet &NaRe}
{*debebit ??} citari aut vocari a diversis ad
diversa loca nec aliquis cogetur duobus
dominis servire nec super eosdem plures
potestatem habebunt nec aliqua potestas
consortis erit impatiens secundum quae
rationes istae {*illae &NaRe} processisse
videntur. Vel ergo declara secundam
{*secundum &MzNaRe} opinionem supra c.
17 recitatam quomodo allegationes istae

modum de quo nunc quaero loqui vel aliquas
alias allegationes conaris adducere {*inducere

is because on that way [of putting it] no one
will have to be cited or called by different
people to different places, no one will be
forced to serve two masters, many men will
not have power over the same people and
there will be no power impatient of a partner,
and it is on the basis of these points that those
arguments seem to have proceeded.
Therefore either make clear how according to
the opinion recorded in chapter 17 above
those arguments are conclusive against that
third way about which I now wish to speak,
or try to bring forward some other arguments.

Magister Licet secundum opinionem supra
{sic &Mz} c. 17 recitatam modus regendi
communitatem fidelium de quo capitulo
praecedenti et c. 17 tractavimus sit multo
perniciosior {et periculosior add. &Na} isto
modo de quo nunc vis conferre, et ideo istae
{*illae &NaRe} allegationes multo patentius
concludunt {*concludant &NaRe} contra illum
modum quam contra istum, cum {*tamen
&NaRe} [[cum in margin but crossed out Re]]
eaedem {illae &Re} allegationes {trs. &Re}
vel aliquae {aliqua &Re} illarum {*earum
&NaRe} convincunt {committunt &Mz}, ut
videtur, istum modum regendi communitatem
fidelium ab optimo modo {*regendi add.
&NaRe} et puniendi reos deficere.

Master Although according to the opinion
recorded in chapter 17 above the way of
ruling the community of believers which we
treated in the preceding chapter and in
chapter 17 is much more destructive than that
way about which you now wish to confer,
and therefore those arguments are more
obviously conclusive against the former than
against the latter. Yet the same arguments, or
some of them, demonstrate, it seems, that that
way of ruling a community of believers
departs from the best way of ruling and
punishing the guilty.

Primae autem duae allegationes contra istum
modum inefficaces apparent. Sed tertia contra
ipsum aliquam apparentiam habere videtur
{videretur &Mz} eo quod tota communitas
fidelium posset regi per unum. Frustra autem
fit per plures quod fieri potest {*trs. &NaRe}
per pauciores. Ergo tales duo rectores, scilicet
ecclesiasticus et secularis, illo {illo add. &Na}
modo frustra ponuntur.

The first two arguments, however, seem
ineffectual against that way [of ruling]. But
the third seems to have some plausibility
against it due to the fact that the whole
community of believers could be ruled by one
person; that which can be done by fewer
people, however, is done in vain by many;
therefore two such rulers, namely an
ecclesiastical and a secular one, are proposed
to no purpose in that way [of ruling].

Quarta allegatio, fundata in auctoritate
The fourth argument, based on the text of the
Salvatoris Matt. 6, nequaquam videtur
saviour in Matthew 6:[24] does not seem to
concludere contra istum modum. Sed {*quinta be conclusive against that way of ruling. But
