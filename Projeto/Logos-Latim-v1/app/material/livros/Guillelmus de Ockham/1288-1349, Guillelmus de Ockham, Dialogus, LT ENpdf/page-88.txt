Discipulus Ista obiectio probabiliter videtur soluta, sed
adhuc alia mihi occurrit. Quia amentes, dormientes et
penitus contradicentes, quamvis baptizentur, si postea
pertinaciter erraverint vel in errore pertinaci
permanserint, non videntur haeretici reputandi, quia nec
ad iurisdictionem ecclesiasticam pertinebunt.

Disciple That objection seems probably answered, but
still another occurs to me. For people who are [baptised
while] insane, asleep, and altogether contradicting it,
even if they are baptized, if they afterwards err
pertinaciously or remain in pertinacious error, do not
seem to be regarded as heretics, because they will not
belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

Magister Dicunt isti describentes praedicto modo
haereticum quod taliter baptizati, si in contradictione
persistunt, nec vero baptismo nec falso intelliguntur
baptizari: non falso constat; nec vero, quia quicunque
baptizatur vero baptismo characterem suscipit
sacramenti.

Master Those who describe the heretic in the above
way say that if people thus baptized persist in
contradiction, they are understood not to be baptized by
either true or false baptism. Certainly not by false; nor
by true, because whoever is baptized by true baptism
receives the character of the sacrament.

Discipulus Quid dicunt de catechumenis et
exprimentibus se habere propositum baptizandi, si
antequam baptizentur inciderint in haereticam
pravitatem vel ad ritum priorem redierint?

Disciple What do they say about catechumens and
those who express an intention to be baptised, if before
they are baptized they fall into heretical wickedness or
return to their previous rite?

Magister Dicunt quidam eorum quod tales sunt velut
haeretici puniendi pro eo quod se pro Catholicis
habuerunt, quare si postea pertinaciter erraverint pro
haereticis sunt habendi. Item, omnes adulti
catechumeni, et asserentes se habere propositum
baptizandi, pro baptizatis baptismo flaminis se gerunt;
ergo tanquam baptizati iudicio ecclesiae sunt subiecti,
et per consequens, si ad vomitum redierint vel in
errorem pertinacem inciderint, sunt per ecclesiam poena
debita percellendi. Alii autem dicunt quod tales
antequam baptizentur ad ecclesiasticam iurisdictionem
non pertinent, quare absque metu poenae ecclesiae et ad
priorem possunt reverti ritum et in aliis pertinaciter
errare.

Master Some of them say that such people should be
punished as heretics because they regard themselves as
Catholics, so if they afterwards err they should be
regarded as heretics. Also, all adult catechumens, and
those who assert that they intend to be baptized, act as
persons baptized by the baptism of the spirit; therefore
they are subject, as baptized people, to the judgment of
the Church, and consequently, if they return to their
vomit or fall into pertinacious error, they should be
struck by the Church with due penalty. Others,
however, say that before they are baptized such people
do not belong to the jurisdiction of the Church;
therefore they can, without fear of the Church's
punishment, return to their previous rite and in other
ways err pertinaciously.

Capitulum 5

Chapter 5.

Discipulus Licet de ista materia possem quaerere plura,
quia tamen modo pauci vel nulli inveniuntur
catechumeni et non baptizati se pro baptizatis gerentes
et praesens opus volui fieri principaliter ut melius
controversias inter Christianos nostris temporibus
ventilatas intelligerem, ad ultimam particulam
descriptionis praemissae me transfero. Videtur enim
quod superflue sit positum "pertinaciter", eo quod
omnis Christianus si simpliciter dubitat vel errat contra
Catholicam veritatem est haereticorum numero
aggregandus.

Disciple Though I could ask many questions about this
matter, nevertheless, because few or no catechumens
are now found, or unbaptised persons behaving as
baptized, and I have wanted the present work to be
made mainly so that I would better understand the
controversies ventilated among the Christians of our
times, I turn to the last element of the description given
above. It seems superfluous to put "pertinaciously",
since every Christian should be added to the number of
the heretics if he simply doubts or errs against Catholic
truth.

To be a heretic is it essential to be pertinacious?
Quod primo videtur posse probari auctoritate Innocentii
III, qui, ut habetur Extra, De verborum significatione, c.
Super quibusdam, scribens Comiti Tholosano, ait: "Tua
devotio postulavit a nobis qui sint dicendi haeretici
manifesti. Super quo tibi duximus respondendum illos
intelligendos manifestos esse haereticos qui contra
Catholicam fidem publice praedicant aut profitentur seu
defendunt errorem, vel qui coram praelatis suis sunt
convicti vel confessi, vel ab eis sententialiter sunt
88

This seems provable, first, by a text of Innocent III. As
we read in Extra, De verborum significatione, c. Super
quibusdam [col.923], writing to the Count of Toulouse,
he says: "Your devotion has asked of us who are to be
called manifest heretics. Upon this we have decided
that you should be given the answer that those should
be understood to be manifest heretics who publicly
preach against the Catholic faith or profess or defend
an error, or who have been convicted or have confessed
