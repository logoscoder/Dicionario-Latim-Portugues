therefore, that the universal church does not err and
has not erred.
Confirmatur haec ratio, quia si quilibet Christianus
tenetur explicite credere ecclesiam universalem non
errare nec errasse, aut ergo tenetur hoc credere quia in
Scriptura Divina asseritur, aut quia ad doctrinam
pertinet universalis ecclesiae, aut quia ex doctrina
universalis ecclesiae vel ex Scriptura Divina manifeste
concluditur, vel quia est ab ecclesia universali explicite
approbatum, vel quia apud omnes Christianos tanquam
catholicum divulgatum existit. Non propter primum,
quia multa in sacra pagina asseruntur quae non quilibet
Christianus tenetur explicite credere, nec propter
secundum per eandem rationem, nec propter tertium
vel quartum propter idem, nec propter quintum quia
haec veritas, "ecclesia universalis non potest errare",
non est apud omnes Christianos simplices et alios
divulgata. Multi enim sunt qui de ea loqui non
audierunt omnino.

This argument is confirmed because if any christian is
bound explicitly to believe that the universal church
does not err and has not erred he is bound to believe
this either because it is asserted in divine scripture or
because it pertains to the teaching of the universal
church or because it is obviously inferred from the
teaching of the universal church or from divine
scripture or because it has been explicitly approved by
the universal church or because it has been published
among all christians as catholic. It is not so for the
first reason, because many things which not every
christian is bound explicitly to believe are asserted in
the holy scriptures, nor for the second for the same
reason, nor for the third or fourth for the same reason,
nor for the fifth because this truth that the universal
church can not err has not been published among all
christians, those who are simple and others. For there
are many who have not heard anyone at all speak
about it.

Discipulus Si haec ratio procederet videretur quod
divulgatio apud Christianos esset maioris auctoritatis
quam Scriptura Divina, quia propter divulgationem
huiusmodi tenerentur omnes Christiani alicui veritati
explicite assentire cui tamen non tenerentur propter
Scripturam Divinam explicite adhaerere.

Disciple If this argument were valid it would seem
that publication among christians would be of greater
authority than divine scripture because all christians
would be bound as a result of such publication to
assent explicitly to some truth to which nevertheless
they would not be bound explicitly to cling because of
divine scripture.

Magister Ad hoc dicitur quod divulgatio apud omnes
Christianos non est maioris auctoritatis quam Scriptura
Divina sed est pluribus nota quam Scriptura Divina. Et
ideo quod omnes Christiani tenentur explicite credere
veritatem apud omnes Christianos etiam simplices
divulgatam et non tenentur omnes explicite credere
omnes veritates contentas in Scriptura Divina, non est
propter maiorem auctoritatem talis divulgationis quam
Scripturae Divinae sed quia talis divulgatio ad notitiam
plurium iam pervenit, et per hoc assignatur ratio quare
quilibet tenetur explicite credere fidem Christianam
esse veram, quia ista veritas apud omnes divulgata
existit, sicut et ista fides quam Christus docuit vera est
et sana.

Master To this it is said that publication among all
christians is not of greater authority than divine
scripture but is known to more people than divine
scripture is. And that all christians are bound
explicitly to believe a truth published among all
christians, even the simple, and are not all bound
explicitly to believe all the truths contained in divine
scripture is therefore not because the authority of such
publication is greater than that of divine scripture but
because such publication has by now come to the
notice of more people. This is the reason why
everyone is bound explicitly to believe that the
christian faith is true, because that truth has been
published among everyone, as has [the truth that] the
faith which Christ taught is true and sound.

Discipulus Dic quomodo respondetur ad rationem pro
assertione contraria.

Disciple Describe how reply is made to the argument
for the contrary assertion.

Magister Respondetur quod peccat per fallaciam
figurae dictionis, quia licet eadem sit fides Christiana et
fides universalis ecclesiae, quando ecclesia non errat,
tamen secundum istos universalis ecclesia consignat
vel significat Christianos in recto, quos taliter non
signat fides Christiana. Et ideo, ut dicunt, non sequitur:
quilibet Christianus tenetur explicite credere fidem

Master It is replied that it is mistaken through the
fallacy of "figure of speech", because although the
christian faith and the faith of the universal church,
when the church does not err, are the same, yet, they
say, "universal church" consignifies or signifies
christians in the nominative case, and "christian faith"
does not signify them in this way. And therefore, they
