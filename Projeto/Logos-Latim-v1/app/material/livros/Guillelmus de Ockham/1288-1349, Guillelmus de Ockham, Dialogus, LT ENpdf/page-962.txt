&Mz} {*illa &NaRe} inter se erunt {*om.
&MzNaRe} dissentientia {*dissentient
&NaRe}, quia quot capita tot sententiae et
opiniones dist. 19. {*dist. 19: De
consecratione &MzNaRe}, dist. 10. {*4
&MzNaRe}, Sicut in sacramentis. Quare
timendum est quod capita illa sive domini
iubebunt contraria {communia &Mz}. Ex quo
infertur quod nullus subditus poterit eis servire.
Et per consequens ista {*illa &NaRe}
communitas quae habet plura capita est
pessime ordinata. Ex quo concluditur quod si
communitas fidelium habet duos summos
{*supremos &NaRe} iudices, scilicet
imperatorem et papam, est periculosa societas
reputanda. Et consimili ratione infertur quod
absque periculis manifestis non possunt in
eodem regno vel provincia aut in {*aut in: ac
etiam &Re} [[Na illegible]] civitate esse duo
iudices supremi super eosdem, ecclesiasticus
videlicet et secularis, praesertim in illo regno,
provincia vel civitate quod vel quae
superiorem de facto in temporalibus non
recognoscit.

and points of view as there are heads (De
consecratione, dist. 4, c. Sicut in sacramentis
[c.151, col.1411]). It should be feared,
therefore, that those heads or lords will order
opposed things. From this we infer that no
subject could serve them. And consequently
that community which has many heads is
very badly regulated. We conclude from this
that if a community of believers has two
supreme judges, namely the emperor and the
pope, it should be regarded as a dangerous
society. And by a similar argument we infer
that in the same kingdom or province and
even city there can not be without clear
dangers two supreme judges, that is an
ecclesiastical and secular one, over the same
people, especially in that kingdom, province
or city which does not in fact recognise any
superior in temporal affairs.

Ad haec {*etiam add. &NaRe} roboranda
adduci potest assertio veritatis quae Matth. 12:
[25] ait, "Omne regnum contra se divisum
{*trs.312 &NaReVg} desolabitur, et omnis
domus vel civitas {*trs.321 &NaReVg} contra
se divisa {*trs.312 &NaReVg} non stabit {sta
&Mz}." Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod
omnis communitas et congregatio {est add.
&Re} propinqua divisioni est propinqua
desolationi et ruinae. Cum ergo communitas
seu congregatio fidelium sit propinqua
divisioni si habeat {*habet &NaRe} duos {om.
&NaRe} iudices supremos, quia capita diversa
sunt prona ad dissentiendum, sequitur quod
communitas seu congregatio fidelium est
propinqua desolationi et ruinae, et per
consequens contra bonum commune est ut
supra se duos habeat iudices {trs. &Na}
supremos.

[5] To strengthen this, an assertion of the
Truth from Matthew 12:25 can also be
adduced, "Every kingdom divided against
itself will be made desolate, and no city or
house divided against itself will stand." We
gather from these words that every
community and congregation which is near to
division is near to desolation and ruin.
Therefore since a community or congregation
of believers is near to division if it has two
supreme judges, because different heads are
inclined to disagreement, it follows that a
community or congregation of believers is
near to desolation and ruin, and consequently
it is against the common good that it have
two supreme judges over it.

[6] The authority of Jerome is also adduced
to this effect. As we read in 7, q. 1, c. In
Ad hoc etiam adducitur auctoritas Hieronimi
qui, ut legitur 7, q. 1, c. In apibus, ad Rusticum apibus [c.41, col.582], he says to the monk
