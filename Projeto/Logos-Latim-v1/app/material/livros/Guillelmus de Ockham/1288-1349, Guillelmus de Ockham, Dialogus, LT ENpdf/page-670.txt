were to have greater power over the
emperor than over other kings he would
have such power either (a) by divine law
or (b) by human law:- [he does] not [have
it] (a) by divine law, because we do not
read anywhere in divine scripture that any
power over the Roman emperor was
bestowed on the pope which was not
granted to him over other kings; nor does
he have such special power over the
emperor (b) by human law, because it
does not seem that anyone gave him or
could have given him power of this
kind:--

quia {quod &Re} si aliquis {*sibi add. &MdMz}
dedit vel dare potuit huiusmodi potestatem aut
fuit imperator aut inferior imperatore; non {*sed
&MzNaRe} imperator {tum add. &Md}

dare {*pape add. &NaRe} talem potestatem

quia non potest imperator magis {*trs.312
&MdNaPeRe} subiicere imperatorem papae
quam alios reges. Tum quia non habet imperium
per {par in parem &Mz} imperatorem {*per
imperatorem: par in parem &NaRe}. Tum quia si
imperator qui dedit talem potestatem Papae super
imperatorem non fuit subiectus Papae et {om.
&MdPe} imperator sequens {francos &Na} fuit
{fuit add. &Na} subiectus Papae, imperator
sequens {fuit ... sequens: om. &MdPe} non fuit
verus successor quia quando successor est magis
subiectus quam praedecessor {quia quando ...
praedecessor: om. &Pe} non est vera successio in
ius alterius {*et add. &MdMzNaPeRe} ita
imperator sequens non esset verus imperator. Et
per consequens imperator qui taliter subiugasset
Romanum imperium Papae fuisset destructor
imperii quantum in se est vel {*est vel om.
&MzNaRe} fuisset et {quo dato sequitur quia

because if someone gave or could give
him power of this kind it was either (a)
the emperor or (b) someone inferior to the
emperor. But (a) the emperor could not
give the pope such power over the
emperor and not over other kings. This is
(i) because an emperor can not subject an
emperor to the pope more than other
kings, (ii) because an equal doe not have
power over an equal, iii) because if an
emperor who gave such power over an
emperor to the pope was not subject to
the pope and the emperor who succeeded
him was subject to the pope, the
succeeding emperor was not a true
successor, because when an emperor is
more subject than his predecessor there is
not a true succession to the right of the
other, and so the succeeding emperor
would not be a true emperor. And so an
emperor who had subjected the Roman
empire to the pope in this way would
have been the destroyer of the empire so
far as in him lay, and consequently he
would have done nothing, because no
emperor can destroy the empire and
anything he would do towards the
destruction of the empire would not hold
up in law but should even be revoked by
his successor as vain in law and in fact.
