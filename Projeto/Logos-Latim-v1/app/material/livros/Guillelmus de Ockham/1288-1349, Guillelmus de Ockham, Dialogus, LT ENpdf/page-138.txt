Cum vero dicis quod magis est reputandus haereticus
qui tenet haeresim damnatam explicite quam qui non
tenet doctrinam catholicam, hoc, si debet concedi,
verum est de illo qui pertinaciter tenet haeresim
damnatam explicite. Si autem nescienter absque omni
pertinacia tenet haeresim damnatam explicite, non
continet veritatem, loquendo scilicet de illo qui non
reputat doctrinam christianam esse veram, de quo
loquitur beatus Iohannes in verbis adductis. Non enim
loquitur beatus Iohannes de illo qui ignoranter aliquam
specialem catholicam veritatem non teneret, quia talis,
nisi alias de pertinacia convinceretur, non esset a
catholicis evitandus.

When you say that someone who holds an explicitly
condemned heresy should more be regarded as a
heretic than someone who does not hold to catholic
teaching, this (if it ought to be granted) is true of him
who holds pertinaciously an explicitly condemned
heresy. If he holds an explicitly condemned heresy
unknowingly and without any pertinacity, however, it
is not true, speaking, that is, in comparison to one who
does not consider christian teaching to be true. Blessed
John, in the words you adduced is speaking of such a
one. For blessed John is not speaking of someone who
out of ignorance might not hold some particular
catholic truth, because such a person should not be
avoided by catholics, unless he were to be convicted of
pertinacity in some other way.

Ad decreta quae adducis breviter respondetur quod
omnia loquuntur de illis qui scienter labuntur in
haeresim iam damnatam.

A brief reply to the decretals which you adduce is that
they all speak about people who knowingly slip into
an already condemned heresy.

Ad consuetudinem inquisitorum quam allegas dicunt
quidam quod inquisitores et nonnulli praelati saepe
inique procedunt et iniuste. Nam multi, ut dicunt, sunt
illiterati et simplices, cupiditate et avaritia excaecati,
qui ideo de haeresi satagunt accusatos condemnare ut
bona eorum acquirant. Et ideo in eorum consuetudine
nulla assertio est fundanda.

To the practice of inquisitors which you bring forward,
some people say that inquisitors and some prelates
often proceed unfairly and unjustly. For they say that
many are unlearned and simple men blinded by greed
and avarice who try to condemn those accused of
heresy in order to acquire their goods. And therefore
no assertion should be based on their practice.

Ad rationem, quae magis urgere videtur, dicunt quod
aliqui tenentes haereses damnatas explicite possunt se
per ignorantiam excusare, aliqui vero non possunt,
quia quidam diversis modis, sicut ex praedictis apparet
et inferius, si interrogationes de hac materia fueris
prosecutus, amplius apparebit, convinci poterunt de
pertinacia manifesta, illi videlicet qui prius eandem
haeresim sciverunt esse damnatam et qui alios ad
tenendum eandem quomodolibet coegerunt et qui
protestabantur se velle eandem irrevocabiliter
defensare, et multi alii de quibus dictum est supra et, si
volueris, dicetur inferius. Illi autem qui nullo modo de
pertinacia possunt convinci et parati sunt corrigi se
poterunt per ignorantiam excusare, dicentes, "Nos
ignoravimus tales haereses esse damnatas; imo
ignoravimus eas veritati catholicae quomodolibet
adversari."

To [the argument from] reason, which seems to be
more forceful, they say that some people who hold
explicitly condemned heresies can excuse themselves
by ignorance, others, on the other hand, can not,
because certain people can be convicted of manifest
heresy in different ways -- as is clear from what has
been said and will be even clearer later if you follow
up with questions on this matter -- those, that is, who
knew beforehand that the heresy was condemned, and
who forced others in any way at all to hold it and who
were proclaiming that they would irrevocably defend
it, and many others who have been spoken about
above and will be spoken about below if you wish.
Those who can not in any way be convicted of
pertinacity, however, and are ready to be corrected can
excuse themselves by ignorance and say: "We did not
know that these are condemned as heresies, indeed we
did not know that they are opposed in any way to
catholic truth."

Discipulus Antequam procedas ulterius dicas an in
sacra pagina et iure canonico eruditi valeant, si tenent
haereses damnatas explicite, se per ignorantiam
excusare.

Disciple Before you proceed further would you say
whether those who are well informed about the sacred
page and canon law can excuse themselves by
ignorance if they hold explicitly condemned heresies.

Magister Dicitur quod sic, quia eruditi non tenentur
habere noticiam de omnibus haeresibus quae sunt
explicite damnatae, et ideo si ignoranter teneant eas
parati corrigi non sunt haeretici reputandi.

Master It is answered yes, because the well informed
are not bound to have knowledge of every heresy that
has been explicitly condemned. They should not be
regarded as heretics, therefore, if they hold them in
