sacris canonibus colligitur evidenter. Cum ergo
explicita damnatio haeresis cuiuscunque publice facta
sit, non potest quis tenens haeresim damnatam explicite
se per ignorantiam excusare. Et per consequens eam
statim revocare tenetur et nullo modo poterit excusari
quin haereticus sit censendus.

explains. In a similar way, therefore, an explicit
condemnation is binding on everyone, at least after
two months. [It does not excuse] (c) because no one
can claim ignorance of those things that are done
publicly, as is clearly gathered from the sacred
canons. Since an explicit condemnation of any heresy
is made publicly, therefore, no one holding an
explicitly condemned heresy can excuse himself
through ignorance. And he is bound, as a
consequence, to retract it immediately and can in no
way be excused so as not to be considered a heretic.

Haec sunt quae mihi admirationem ingerunt quod viri
literati dicunt quod aliquis potest tenere haeresim
damnatam explicite, quamvis non sit haereticus, et
quod ideo non statim tenetur talem haeresim revocare.
Unde qualiter respondeant ad ista non differas reserare?

What astonishes me is that learned men say that
someone can hold an explicitly condemned heresy,
although he is not a heretic, and that he is not,
therefore, bound to retract that heresy immediately.
Would you not delay but explain how they would
reply to these (arguments)?

Capitulum 20

Chapter 20

Magister Pro assertione praedicta argutum est supra
libro 3, quia probatum est ibidem quod non omnis
errans contra fidem est haereticus reputandus. Illa
autem argumenta ibidem adducta concludunt quod
etiam tenens haeresim damnatam explicite non est
statim haereticus iudicandus. Ex quo sequitur quod
non statim tenetur suam haeresim revocare.

Master The aforesaid assertion was argued for in book
3 above, because it was proved there that not everyone
erring against the faith should be regarded as a heretic.
The arguments brought forward there conclude,
moreover, that even someone holding an explicitly
condemned heresy should not be judged a heretic
immediately. It follows from this that he is not bound
to retract his heresy immediately.

Discipulus Si fundant se in aliqua ratione speciali ad
probandum quod tenens haeresim damnatam explicite
non sit statim inter haereticos computandus, illam
libenter audirem.

Student If they rely on some particular argument to
prove that someone holding an explicitly condemned
heresy should not be counted among the heretics
immediately, I would be pleased to hear it.

Magister Una ratio eorum talis est. Nullus est magis
reputandus haereticus propter haeresim explicite
damnatam ab ecclesia quam propter haeresim cuius
contradictoria in Scriptura Divina sententialiter et
vocaliter continetur, nisi talis damnatio sit magis
divulgata inter christianos quam veritas Scripturae
Divinae. Sed multae sunt haereses damnatae explicite
a consiliis generalibus quae non sunt magis divulgatae
quam Scriptura Divina. Et non semper est aliquis
statim reputandus haereticus si tenet aliquam haeresim
cuius contradictoria in sacris literis reperitur, sed
examinandus est an scienter vel nescienter, et si
nescienter, an pertinaciter vel absque pertinacia teneat
haeresim. Ergo similiter licet quis teneat haeresim
damnatam explicite non est semper statim haereticus
reputandus, sed investigandum est primo an de
pertinacia possit convinci per testes vel alia legitima
documenta. Et si non potest probari quod fuerit
pertinax, examinandus est an paratus sit se corrigere si
sibi ostendatur aperte quod haeresis sua est explicite

Master One of their arguments is this. No one should
be more regarded as a heretic because of a heresy
explicitly condemned by the church than because of a
heresy the contradiction of which is found in the
meaning or words of divine scripture, unless such a
condemnation has been more widely published among
christians than the truth of divine scripture. But there
are many heresies explicitly condemned by general
councils which have not been more widely published
than divine scripture. And someone should not always
be immediately regarded as a heretic if he holds some
heresy the contradiction of which is found in the
sacred writings, but he should be examined about
whether (he holds it) knowingly or unknowingly, and,
if unknowingly, whether he holds the heresy
pertinaciously or without pertinacity. In a similar way,
therefore, even if someone holds an explicitly
condemned heresy he should not always be regarded
immediately as a heretic, but it should be examined
first whether he can be convicted of pertinacity by
