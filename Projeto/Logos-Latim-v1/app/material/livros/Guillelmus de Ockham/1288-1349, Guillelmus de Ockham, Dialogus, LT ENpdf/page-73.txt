Magister Dicunt isti quod hoc omni probabilitate
caret, quia nullam verisimilitudinem habet quod
damnationes opinionum Thomae et aliorum, quae
solenniter et publice pluries factae fuerunt Parisius et
in Anglia, summos pontifices latuissent, praesertim
cum quidam de Ordine Praedicatorum contra
damnationem latam in Anglia ab archiepiscopo
Cantuariensi contra quasdam opiniones Thomae ad
curiam Romanam appellaverint et illa de causa
accesserint ad eandem. Dicunt ergo quod quamvis
fama quod opinantes essent haeretici non pervenerit ad
Romanos pontifices, ipsos tamen non latuit quod
opiniones eorum damnatae fuerunt Parisius et in
Anglia. Quare ad inquisitionem faciendam procedere
debuerunt, exemplo sanctorum patrum qui, antequam
Arrius, Eumonius, Macedonius, Nestorius et alii multi
pertinaces convincerentur haeresum defensores, de
ipsis et eorum dogmatibus inquisitionem fecere
solertem, exemplo etiam Innocentii 3, qui, ut habetur
Extra, De summa trinitate et fide catholia, c.
Damnamus, quamvis Ioachim sui erroris nunquam
fuerit pertinax defensator et licet eidem errori
solemnissimus tunc temporis doctor Ricardus de sancto
Victore adhaeserit, quamvis non pertinaciter, ad
inquisitionem et damnationem faciendas processit.

Master They say that this lacks all probability
because it is not at all plausible that the
condemnations of the opinions of Thomas and of
others, which were often solemnly and publicly
pronounced at Paris and in England, had been
unknown to the highest pontiffs, especially since some
members of the Order of Preachers appealed to the
Roman curia against the condemnation published in
England by the archbishop of Canterbury of some of
Thomas's opinions and for that reason they [the
appellants] had gone to Rome. Therefore they say that
even if the report that those opiners were heretics did
not reach the Roman pontiffs, it was nevertheless not
unknown to them that their opinions had been
condemned in Paris and in England. Therefore they
ought to have proceeded to the making of an
inquisition, on the example of the holy fathers who
made an expert inquisition into Arius, Eumonius,
Macedonius, Nestorius and many others and their
teachings before they were convicted as pertinacious
defenders of heresies, and on the example too of
Innocent III who, as we find in Extra, De summa
trinitate et fide catholica, c. Damnamus [col.6],
proceeded to the making of an inquisition and a
condemnation although Joachim was never a
pertinacious defender of his error and although a most
fully qualified doctor of that time, Richard of St.
Victor, adhered, but not pertinaciously, to the same
error.

Chapter 30

Discipulus Ista exempla animum meum fortiter
angunt, unde cupio scire si aliqui aliter dictos summos
pontifices excusare nitantur.

Student Those examples greatly distress my mind and
so I want to know whether some people try to excuse
the said highest pontiffs in some other way.

Magister Quidam per simplicitatem et imperitiam
Scripturarum eos excusant, dicentes quod a tempore
Innocentii 3 non fuerunt aliqui summi pontifices in
sacrarum literarum peritia excellentes, et ideo de
intricatis et difficilibus quaestionibus se intromittere
nullatenus voluerunt, sed talia discutienda theologis
reliquerunt, contenti his quae explicite approbata
noscuntur. De opinionibus vero novis magis voluerunt
iuxta consilium beati Hieronymi pie dubitare quam
aliquid temere diffinire.

Master Some people excuse them by their simplicity
and ignorance of the scriptures, saying that since the
time of Innocent III there have been no highest
pontiffs who excelled in knowledge of sacred letters,
and so they have not wanted to involve themselves in
perplexing and difficult questions but have left such
matters to be discussed by theologians, contenting
themselves with those matters that are known to have
been explicitly approved. About new opinions,
however, they have wanted rather to doubt them
piously, in accordance with the advice of blessed
Jerome {actually Peter Comestor, Historia
Scholastica, PL 198, col.1643], than to define
something rashly.

Discipulus Ista sententia concordare videtur cum illis
qui dicunt quod non ad canonistas sed ad theologos
principaliter pertinet inter assertiones haereticales et
catholicas veritates iudicare. Plures enim post tempora
Innocentii 3 fuerunt summi pontifices qui peritissimi in
iure canonico extiterunt, licet in theologia non fuerint

Student That opinion seems to agree with those who
say that it pertains chiefly to theologians not to
canonists to judge between heretical and catholic
assertions. For there have been many highest pontiffs
after the times of Innocent III who have been very
learned in canon law, although they have not been
