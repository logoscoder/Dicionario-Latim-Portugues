hiis colligitur quod beatus Marcellinus papa contra
fidem erravit scelus ydolatrie committendo.

burial' and in tears he said, 'Alas how bitter I am that I
can not remain in the priesthood.'" We gather from
this that blessed Pope Marcellin erred against the faith
by committing the crime of idolatry.

Discipulus Per ista non probatur quod beatus
Marcellinus erravit in mente contra fidem sed actum
idolatrie solummodo commisit coactus.

Student: That does not prove that blessed Marcellin
erred against the faith in intention but only that when
forced he committed an act of idolatry.

Magister Verum est quod beatus Marcellinus non
erravit in mente pravitati heretice adherendo; ex hoc
tamen quod facto negavit Christum dum renuit
confiteri se esse Christianum, infertur quod potuit
errare in mente et quod potuit effici hereticus sicut
idolatra fuit effectus.

Master: It is true that blessed Marcellin did not err in
intention by clinging to heretical wickedness, but
from the fact that he denied Christ in refusing to
confess that he was a Christian, we infer that he could
have erred in intention and could have become a
heretic just as he became an idolater.

Discipulus Dic alia exempla.

Student: Tell me some other examples.

Magister Tercium exemplum ponitur de Liberio papa
qui consensit perfidie Arriane, sicut in cronicis legitur
manifeste.

Master: A third example given concerns Pope
Liberius who, as we clearly read in the chronicles,
agreed with the perfidy of Arianism.

Discipulus Non legitur quod Liberius existens verus
papa Arrianis consenserit sed solummodo postquam
renunciavit papatui.

Student: We do not read that Liberius agreed with the
Arians when he was a true pope, but only after he
renounced the papacy.

Magister Dicunt isti quod nullus papa manens papa
potest errare pertinaciter contra fidem, quia eo ipso
quod pertinaciter contra fidem errat est papatu privatus
de iure, licet de facto gereret se pro papa, et ideo non
intendunt isti quod papa potest fieri hereticus cum
manet papa, sed quod verus papa primo postea potest
hereticari. Quod contigit de Liberio supradicto qui
primo fuit verus papa et postea hereticus est effectus.
Quod autem primo renunciaverit papatui hoc accidit;
poterat enim hereticari licet numquam renunciasset
papatui.

Master: They say that no pope can err pertinaciously
against the faith while he remains pope because from
the fact that he errs pertinaciously against the faith he
is by right deprived of the papacy even if in fact he
were behaving as pope; and they do not mean,
therefore, that a pope can become a heretic while he
remains pope but that he can be a true pope at first
and later become a heretic. This happened to Liberius
who was first a true pope and later became a heretic.
It is inessential that he renounced the papacy first, for
he could have become a heretic even if he had never
renounced the papacy.

Discipulus Suntne plura exempla?

Student: Are there more examples?

Magister Quartum exemplum ponitur de Anastasio II
qui propter hereticam pravitatem fuit a Romana
repudiatus ecclesia. De quo in decretis dist. 19, sic
legitur, "Anastasius secundus nacione Romanus fuit
temporibus Theodorici regis. Eodem tempore multi
clerici se a communione ipsius abegerunt eo quod
communicasset sine consilio episcoporum vel
presbyterorum et cuncte ecclesie catholice dyacono
ecclesie Thessalonicensi nomine Fotino qui
communicaverat Achacio; et quia voluit occulte
revocare Achacium et non potuit nutu Dei percussus
est" quia, ut dicit glossa et accipitur a cronicis, "Dum
assellaret, emisit intestina." Ex hiis patet quod iste
Anastasius pravitate heretica extitit maculatus, propter
quam clerici catholici se ab eius communione

Master: A fourth example is cited concerning
Anastasius II who was repudiated by the Roman
church because of heretical wickedness. We read as
follows about him in the decretals at dist. 19, [c.9;
col.64], "Anastasius II, a Roman by birth, lived in the
time of King Theodoric. At that time many clerics
renounced communion with him because, without
seeking advice from bishops or presbyters and the
whole catholic church, he had had dealings with a
deacon of the church at Thessalonica, named Fotinus,
who had associated with Achacius, and because he
secretly wanted to recall Achacius and could not do so
he was struck down by God's command", because, as
the gloss says [s. v. divino, col.87] (it is taken from
the chronicles), "While he was at stool his intestines
