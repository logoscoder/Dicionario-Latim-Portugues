qualiter praedictis obiectionibus respondetur indicare
digneris.

me. Would you deign to indicate, therefore, how reply
is made to the above objections.

Magister Qui praedictam descriptionem assignant
dupliciter respondere conantur. Primo enim dicunt
quod aliqua haeresis dicitur nova non quia in rei
veritate incipiat noviter esse haeresis, sed quia noviter
est asserta, illo modo loquendi quo aliquae veritates,
etiam necessarie necesse, dicuntur esse novae non quin
prius fuerint veritates sed dicuntur novae quia sunt
noviter publice dogmatizatae. Tali etiam modo aliqui
errores dicuntur esse novi non quin prius fuerint in rei
veritate errores sed dicuntur novi quia noviter sunt
asserti. Et iste modus loquendi ex verbis Gelasii papae,
ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. 1, colligitur evidenter. Ait enim,
"Achatius non est factus inventor novi erroris, sed
veteris imitator." Cui concordat Felix papa eisdem c. et
q. c. Achatius dicens, "Achatius non fuit novi vel
proprii inventor erroris." Ex quibus verbis datur
intelligi quod si Achatius fuisset primus sui erroris
assertor fuisset reputatus novi erroris inventor, et
tamen idem error antea fuisset error censendus. Multi
enim errores antequam asserantur ab aliquo ab aliis
non errantibus reprobantur, et per consequens
antequam habeant assertorem seu defensorem sunt
errores censendi; et tamen secundum unum modum
loquendi si aliquis inciperet eos defendere dicerentur
novi errores. Consimili etiam modo loquendi quidam
Athenienses, ut habetur Actuum 17, dicebant de beato
Paulo, "Novorum daemoniorum videtur annunciator
esse ", appellantes "nova daemonia" non quia putabant
quod antea non fuissent daemonia sed quia putabant
antiqua daemonia a Paulo noviter praedicari. Ita dicunt
aliqui aliquas haereses vocari novas propter novitatem
assertionis vel defensionis quia aliquis eas noviter
asserit vel defendit quae tamen prius in rei veritate
fuerunt haereses reputandae.

Master Those who assign the above description try to
reply in two ways. For they say firstly that any heresy
is said to be new not because in truth of fact it begins
newly to be a heresy, but because it is newly asserted,
in that way of speaking by which any truths, even
those that are necessary, are said to be new not in that
they were not truths before but are said to be new
because they have been newly propounded in public.
In that way too some errors are said to be new not
because in truth of fact they were not errors before but
they are said to be new because they have been newly
asserted. We clearly gather this way of speaking from
the words of Pope Gelasius found in 24, q. 1, c. 1
[ col.966]. For he says, "Achatius did not become the
inventor of a new error but the imitator of an old one."
Pope Felix agrees with this in the same causa and
quaestio c. Achatius [col.966] when he says,
"Achatius was not the inventor of a new error or of his
own error." We are given to understand by these
words that if Achatius had been the first to affirm his
error he would have been regarded as the inventor of a
new error, and yet that error had been considered an
error previously. For before they are affirmed by
someone many errors are condemned by others who
are not in error, and consequently they should be
considered errors before they have an assertor or a
defender; and yet according to one way of speaking, if
someone were to begin to defend them they would be
called new errors. In a similar way of speaking too
certain Athenians said of blessed Paul, as we find in
Acts 17[:18], "He seems to be a proclaimer of new
demons", calling them "new demons" not because
they thought that they had not been demons before but
because they thought that they were old demons
newly preached by Paul. In this way some people say
that certain heresies are called new because of a new
assertion or defence of them, because someone newly
asserts or defends those which nevertheless should
previously have been regarded in truth of fact as
heresies.

Aliter respondent praedictis, ut dicunt, minime
obviando quod quemadmodum, ut notat in glossa
Extra, De summa trinitate et fide catholica, c. 1, fides
aliquando dicitur credulitas secundum quam credimus
quod non videmus, et alio modo dicitur collectio
articulorum fidei, licet etiam dicatur aliis sex modis ut
habetur ibidem, sic tam error quam haeresis potest
dupliciter dici. Potest enim error uno modo dici actus
vel habitus quo quis errat, alio modo ipsum obiectum
talis habitus vel actus errandi vocatur error. Haeresis
etiam potest accipi uno modo pro actu vel habitu
haeresis, alio modo dicitur obiectum talis habitus vel
actus. Primo modo accipiendo haeresim et consimiliter
errorem multae possunt esse novae haereses et novi

Otherwise they reply to the above, as they say,
without opposing it, that just as faith is sometimes
said to be the credence by which we believe what we
do not see, and in another way is said to be a
collection of articles of faith, as we find in the gloss
on Extra, De summa trinitate et fide catholica, c. 1
[col.5] - although it may also be used in another six
ways as we find in the same place - so error as well as
heresy can be used in two ways. For in one way an
error can be said to be the act or disposition by which
someone errs, in another way the very object of such a
disposition or act of erring is called an error. A heresy
too can be taken in one way for the act or disposition
of heresy, in another way it is said to be the object of
