Amplius quod omnes apostoli, saltem alii a
beato Petro, fuerint subiecti imperatori et aliis
dominis secularibus, probatur per illud beati
Petri canonica sua 1, 7 {*2 &NaRe}:[13],
"Subiecti estote omni creature propter Deum
sive regi precellenti sive ducibus tanquam ab
eo missis ad vindictam malefactorum, laudem
vero bonorum." Ex quibus verbis colligitur
quod beatus Petrus voluit omnes subditos suos
in spiritualibus esse subditos {subiectos &Na},
sicut ante conversionem, omni creature que
super eos ante habuerat potestatem. Nam, ut
testatur Innocentius tertius, Extra, De
maioritate et obedientia, Solite, beatus Petrus
ibidem "scribebat subditis suis et eos ad
humilitatis meritum {om. &Na} provocabat";
sed apostoli erant subditi beati Petri; ergo
beatus Petrus voluit, quod apostoli essent
subditi {subiecti &Na} regibus et ducibus,
quibus fuerant, antequam essent christiani,
subiecti.

Further, that the apostles, at least those other
than Peter, were subject to the emperor and
other secular lords is proved by what Peter
says in 1 Peter 2:13, "For the Lord's sake
accept the authority of every human
institution, whether of the emperor as
supreme, or of governors as sent by him to
punish those who do wrong and to praise
those who do right." We gather from these
words that blessed Peter wanted all his
subjects to be subject in spiritual matters, just
as before their conversion, to every authority
that had previously had power over them. For
as Innocent III attests in Extra, De maioritate
et obedientia, c. Solitae [c.6, col.196] blessed
Peter at that point "was writing to his subjects
and challenging them to the merit of
humility"; but the apostles were subjects of
blessed Peter; therefore blessed Peter wanted
the apostles to be subject to the kings and
governors to whom they had been subject
before they were christians.

Third argument for Opinion 2A

Magister Alia racio que in scripturis fundatur
adducitur, que talis est. Si religio christiana
nullum dominum aut principem infidelem,
imperatorem vel alium privat iure suo, sicut
ostensum est prius, multo forcius imperatorem
fidelem et alios dominos fideles non privat iure
suo, quod apostolus 1 Timoth. 6:[1-2] aperte
insinuare videtur, qui postquam dixit,
"Quicunque sunt sub iugo servi, dominos suos
omni honore dignos arbitrentur, ne nomen
domini et doctrina blasphemetur," statim
subiunxit, "Qui autem fideles habent dominos,
non contempnant, quia fratres sunt, sed magis
serviant, quia fideles et dilecti." Imperator ergo
fidelis per religionem christianam nullum ius
perdidit; ergo papa in omnibus est subiectus
imperatori, in quibus fuit subiectus ante
papatum.

Master We adduce as follows another
argument, which is based on the scriptures.
If, as has been shown above, the christian
religion does not deprive any unbelieving
lord, prince, emperor or other [ruler] of his
right, it is much more the case that it does not
deprive a believing emperor and other
believing lords of their right, as the apostle
clearly seems to imply in 1 Tim. 6:1-2. After
he has said, "Let all who are under the yoke
of slavery regard their masters as worthy of
all honour," he immediately added, "Those
who have believing masters must not be
disrespectful to them on the grounds that they
are brothers; rather they must serve them all
the more since they are brothers and
beloved." Therefore a believing emperor lost
no right because of the christian religion; the
