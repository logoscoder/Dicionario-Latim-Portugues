non dicitur haereticus si paratus est corrigi." Sed
possibile est aliquem negare assertionem catholicam
apud catholicos divulgatam quamvis nesciatur an
paratus sit corrigi per regulam fidei, scilicet per
Scripturam Sacram. Potest enim quis talem assertionem
negare et tamen offerre se paratum corrigi si sibi
ostendatur quod dicta assertio in sacra pagina vel in
determinatione ecclesiae continetur. Ergo talis non est
statim pertinax et haereticus iudicandus sed
examinandus est an paratus sit corrigi.

on [s. v. ad recipiendam] dist. 17, c. Nec licuit
[cols.69-70] says: "Just because someone errs, he is
not said to be a heretic if he is ready to be corrected."
But it is possible for someone to deny an assertion
published among catholics as catholic although it may
not be known whether he is ready to be corrected by
the rule of faith, that is by sacred scripture. For
anyone can deny such an assertion and yet present
himself as ready to be corrected if it is shown to him
that that assertion is contained on the sacred page or
in a determination of the church. Such a person,
therefore, should not be judged immediately to be
pertinacious and a heretic but should be questioned
about whether he is ready to be corrected.

Discipulus Ista allegatio videtur fortis et dominum
Iohannem sufficienter excusat etiam esto quod erret.

Disciple That argument seems strong and adequately
excuses the lord John even if he errs.

Magister Alii reputant dictam allegationem nullam,
quia ex ipsa sequeretur, sicut tactum est prius, quod
cuilibet Christiano negare liceret Christum esse verum
hominem vel fuisse crucifixum. Posset enim dicere
absque pertinacia per allegationem istam, "Nego
Christum fuisse crucifixum, tamen paratus sum corrigi
si mihi per Scripturam Sacram vel determinationem
ecclesiae ostendatur Christum fuisse crucifixum."

Master Others regard that argument as a nullity
because it would follow from it, as was touched on
above, that it would be permissible for any christian
to deny that Christ was a true man or that he was
crucified. For, according to that argument, he could
without pertinacity say: "I deny that Christ was
crucified; I am ready to be corrected, however, if it is
shown to me from sacred scripture or a determination
of the church that Christ was crucified."

Discipulus Quare non potest talis excusari ex quo
paratus est corrigi?

Disciple Why can not such a person be excused since
he is ready to be corrected?

Magister Ideo, secundum multos, talis excusari non
debet quia, esto quod esset possibile quod aliquis talis
paratus esset corrigi, tamen contra talem,
quantumcunque dicat se paratum corrigi, est de
pertinacia et quod non est paratus corrigi tam violenta
praesumptio, ex quo non ignorat assertionem negatam
esse tam publice praedicatam et assertam per
ecclesiam, quod non est sibi credendum cum dicit se
paratum corrigi. Dictis enim multorum est fides
nullatenus adhibenda. Hinc de tali negante assertionem
catholicam publice praedicatam dicit Stephanus papa,
ut habetur Extra, De haereticis c. 1, "Nec eis omnino
credendum est qui fidem veritatis ignorant". Talibus
enim nec cum contra alios testificari nituntur nec cum
testimonium perhibent de seipsis est omnino
credendum. Quare quamvis dicant se paratos corrigi
sunt pertinaces et haeretici reputandi.

Master Many say that such a person should not be
excused because, even if it were possible that any
such person would be ready to be corrected,
nevertheless, against such a person, however much he
says that he is ready to be corrected, there is so
violent a presumption that he is pertinacious and not
prepared to be corrected, because he is not ignorant
that the assertion he denies has been publicly
preached and asserted by the church, that he should
not be believed when he says that he is ready to be
corrected. For there are many people in whose words
no trust should be placed. Hence Pope Stephen, as we
find in Extra, De hereticis, c. 1, [col. 778] says of
someone like this who denies an assertion publicly
preached as catholic that "those who do not know the
reliability of truth should not be believed at all." For
such people should not be believed at all whether they
strive to testify against others or present testimony
about themselves. Although they say that they are
ready to be corrected, therefore, they should be
regarded as pertinacious and heretics.
