nunc de articulo fidei. Aliter potest accipi articulus
fidei large, pro omni catholica veritate, et isto modo est
nunc sermo de articulo fidei. Et sic non potest papa
facere novum articulum fidei, nec Alexander fecit
talem novum articulum fidei quia non fecit novam
catholicam veritatem sed fecit quod nec asserendo nec
opinando liceret dicere contrarium illius quod ante fuit
catholica veritas et quod dicentes contrarium
excommunicationis sententiae subderentur. Et ita ista,
Christus secundum quod homo est aliquid, ante
Alexandrum 3 fuit vere catholica veritas, sed ante
tempora Alexandri non innotuit ecclesiae quod esset
catholica. Ex illis enim quae in Scripturis Divinis
habentur veritates multae sequuntur quae tamen latent
ecclesiam, et ideo catholicae sunt, licet ecclesia
nondum discusserit an catholicam sapiant veritatem.

speaking about an article of faith in that sense.
Otherwise "article of faith" can be taken broadly, as
any catholic truth, and the discussion now is about an
article of faith in that sense. And in this sense a pope
can not make a new article of faith, and Alexander did
not produce such a new article of faith because he did
not produce a new catholic truth but brought it about
that neither by asserting nor by opining would it be
permissible to say the contrary of what was previously
a catholic truth and that those saying the contrary
would be subjected to a sentence of excommunication.
And so before Alexander III it was truly a catholic
truth that Christ as a man is something, but before his
time it was not known to the church that it was
catholic. For from what we find in the divine
scriptures many truths follow which nevertheless are
hidden from the church, and so they are catholic even
if the church has not yet investigated whether they
smack of catholic truth.

Capitulum 16

Chapter 16

Discipulus Quia diffinitio haeresis de qua disseruisti
plura conveniens mihi videtur, nec tamen ex ea
intelligo an haeresis sit species specialissima vel sub se
plures species habens, de hoc quid sentiant literati non
postponas exprimere.

Student Because the definition of heresy about which
you have spoken much seems reasonable to me, and
yet I do not understand from it whether heresy is an
ultimate species or has many species within it, would
you not delay describing what the learned think about
this.

Are there several kinds of heresies?
Magister De diffinitione specifica sunt plures
opiniones. Quidam enim dicunt quod eadem res sub
diversis speciebus collocari non potest, quidam dicunt
contrarium.

Master There are several opinions on the definition of
a species. For some people say that the same thing can
not be put under different species, while some say the
opposite.

Discipulus De talibus difficultatibus te nullatenus
intromittas. Nam ad philosophicas scientias spectant
quarum difficultates proprias quantum potes evita. Sed
dic mihi nunc quid tenetur de haeresibus, an omnes sub
uno modo vel nomine aut specie continentur vel sub
pluribus.

Student Would you not involve yourself in such
difficulties. For they pertain to the philosophical
sciences, the particular difficulties of which you
should avoid as much as you can. But tell me now
what is held about heresies, whether they are all
comprehended under the one mode or name or
species, or under several.

Magister Intentionem tuam adverto et ideo ad mentem
tuam volo tibi opiniones contrarias recitare. Si recolis,
de veritatibus catholicis opiniones narravi, quia quidam
dicunt quod illae solae veritates sunt catholicae
reputandae quae explicite vel implicite in Scripturis
Divinis habentur. Alii autem asserunt quod praeter illas
veritates sunt nonnullae aliae inter catholicas veritates
numerandae. Iuxta istas opiniones sunt etiam de
haeresibus opiniones contrariae. Quidam enim tradunt
quod haeresis habet solummodo sub se tres species
sive tres modos haeresum diversarum propter quas
solummodo debet quis puniri. Prima species vel primus

Master I advert to your intention and so I want to
record the opposing opinions for you according to
your thoughts. If you remember, I reported opinions
about catholic truths, because some people say that
only those truths should be regarded as catholic which
are found explicitly or implicitly in the divine
scriptures. However, others assert that besides those
some other truths should be reckoned among catholic
truths. In line with these opinions there are also
opposing opinions about heresies. For some people
teach that there are only three species of heresy or
three modes of different heresies on account of which
