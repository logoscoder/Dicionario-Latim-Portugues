inniteretur solummodo humanae voluntati, et ita fides
nostra esset in voluntate hominum. Cum tamen asserat
Apostolus quod fides nostra non est in sapientia
hominum 1 ad Corinthios 2 et multo fortius non est in
voluntate hominum. Ecclesia igitur universalis nullam
recipit veritatem tanquam catholicam nisi quia
divinitus revelatur vel quia in sacris literis invenitur.
Talis autem veritas etiam si nulla esset ecclesia vere
esset catholica.

the heresies all false assertions of this kind that were
contrary to naturally known truths and could condemn
as a heretic everyone who affirms any false assertion
of this kind which is contrary to any naturally known
truth, and this should be regarded as irrational. [Aiiid]
Or the universal church accepts such a truth because it
pleases it, and this can not be said because then the
universal church would rely only on human will in
accepting some truth and making it catholic, and so
our faith would rest on on human will. Yet since the
apostle affirms in 1 Cor. 2[:5] that our faith does not
rest on human wisdom, much more is it so that it does
not rest on human will. The universal church accepts
no truth as catholic, therefore, unless it is revealed
divinely or is found in the sacred writings. Such a
truth, however, would be truly catholic even if there
were no church.

Si detur quartum, scilicet quod aliqua veritas est
catholica quia sequitur ex illis vel aliquo illorum quae
sunt divinitus revelata et in Scripturis Divinis inserta et
ab ecclesia universali recepta, et palam est quod
propter approbationem ecclesiae non magis potest ex
eis inferri. Ergo per talem approbationem non fit
catholica, sed ante fuit catholica.

[See Significant Variants, para. 5.] [Aiv] If the fourth
is granted, namely that some truth is catholic because
it follows from those things or some of those things
which have been divinely revealed and inserted in the
divine scriptures and accepted by the universal
church, it is also clear that it can not be inferred from
them more because of the church's approval. It would
not be made catholic because of such approval,
therefore, but it was catholic before that.

Si detur quintum, scilicet quod ideo aliqua veritas est
catholica quia est a summo pontifice approbata, tunc
quaerendum est an summus pontifex veritatem aliquam
approbando innititur revelationi divinae vel Scripturis
Sacris aut doctrinae universalis ecclesiae, et
quodcunque istorum detur sequitur quod summus
pontifex per approbationem suam non facit talem
veritatem esse catholicam sed talem veritatem fuisse et
esse catholicam determinat et diffinit. Vel summus
pontifex approbando aliquam veritatem propriae
prudentiae vel voluntati innititur, et si hoc dicatur
sequitur quod propter talem approbationem summi
pontificis non est aliqua veritas pro catholica
acceptanda, quia fides nostra nec in sapientia nec in
voluntate hominis potest consistere.

[Av] If the fifth is granted, namely that some truth is
catholic because it has been approved by the highest
pontiff, then it should be asked whether in approving
the truth the highest pontiff relies on divine revelation
or on the sacred scriptures or on the teaching of the
universal church, and whichever of these is granted it
follows that the highest pontiff does not make such a
truth catholic by his approval, but he determines and
defines that such a truth was and is catholic. Or in
approving some truth the highest pontiff relies on his
own prudence or will, and if this is said it follows that
the truth should not be accepted as catholic because of
this approval by the highest pontiff because our faith
can not rest on the wisdom or will of a man.

Patet igitur quod nulla veritas est catholica nisi quia
divinitus revelata vel quia in Scripturis Divinis inserta
vel quia per certitudinem ecclesiae universali innotuit
vel quia ex aliquo illorum necessario argumento
concluditur. Nullum autem praedictorum ex
approbatione summi pontificis vel etiam ecclesiae
noscitur dependere. Ergo per approbationem talem
nulla veritas catholica fieri potest, sed per talem
approbationem aliqua veritas fuisse et esse catholica
diffinitur. Et ita summus pontifex non facit aliquam
assertionem esse catholicam vel haerticam, sed per
approbationem suam determinat et diffinit veritates
quas approbat esse et fuisse catholicas et per

It is clear therefore that no truth is catholic unless it
has been divinely revealed or has been inserted in the
divine scriptures or has become known to the
universal church as a certainty or because it is inferred
by necessary argument from any of those. None of
these, however, is known to depend on the approval of
the highest pontiff or also of the church. Therefore no
truth can be made catholic through such approval, but
through such approval a truth is designated as having
been and being catholic. And so the highest pontiff
does not make any assertion catholic or heretical, but
by his approval he determines and defines truths that
he approves as being and having been catholic and by
