pertinacia convincendi.
erring of pertinacity?

Magister Decimoquarto potest de pertinacia quis
convinci si verbis vel factis protestatur se assertionem
suam quae est haereticalis minime revocaturum quia
talis non est paratus corrigi. Et per consequens pertinax
est censendus.

Master Someone can be convicted of pertinacity in a
fourteenth way if he bears witness in deeds or words
that he will not retract an assertion of his which is
heretical, because such a person is not ready to be
corrected. As a consequence he should be considered
pertinacious.

Discipulus Dic alium modum.

Student Tell of another way.

Magister Decimoquinto convincitur quis errans de
pertinacia et haeretica pravitate si in favorem haereticae
pravitatis prohibet legi scripturas catholicas vel prohibet
praedicari aut publicari catholicas veritates quia talis est
defensor haereticae falsitatis et oppressor catholicae
veritatis.

Master Someone erring is convicted in a fifteenth way
of pertinacity and heretical wickedness if he prevents
the reading of catholic writings out of partiality to
heretical wickedness or prevents the preaching or
publication of catholic truths, because such a person is
a defender of heretical falsity and a suppressor of
catholic truth.

Discipulus Estne alius modus convincendi errantem de Student Is there another way of convicting an errant of
pertinacia?
pertinacity?

Magister Decimosexto convincitur quis de pertinacia
qui in defensionem haereticae pravitatis novos errores
fingit et defendit quia talis non est paratus corrigi nec
quaerit cauta sollicitudine veritatem. Ergo pertinax est
censendus.

Master Someone is convicted of pertinacity in a
sixteenth way who fabricates and defends new errors in
defence of heretical wickedness, because such a person
is not ready to be corrected and is not seeking the truth
with cautious responsibility. He should be considered,
therefore, as pertinacious.

CAPITULUM 32.

Chapter 32.

Discipulus Alium modum vellem audire.

Student I would like to hear of another way.

Magister Decimoseptimo secundum nonnullos potest
specialiter papa convinci de pertinacia et haeretica
pravitate si errorem contra fidem diffinit solenniter et a
Christianis asserit tanquam catholicum esse tenendum.
Quod enim talis papa sit haereticus reputandus probatur
primo sic. Qui artat alios ad errorem pertinaciter
defendendum est pertinax reputandus. Hoc ex
superioribus colligitur evidenter. Sed papa solenniter
aliquem errorem diffiniens esse catholicum artat
christianos quantum in eo est ad errorem pertinaciter
defendendum et servandum, quia, sicut constitutio sedis
apostolicae legitime facta omnes astringit, ut habetur

Master Some people say that in a seventeenth way the
pope especially can be convicted of pertinacity and
heretical wickedness if he solemnly defines an error
against the faith and asserts that it should be held by
christians as catholic. For that such a pope should be
regarded as heretical is proved first as follows. He who
constrains others to defend an error pertinaciously
should be regarded as pertinacious - we clearly gather
this from what was said above. But a pope solemnly
defining some error to be catholic constrains christians,
as far as in him lies, pertinaciously to defend and
preserve an error. For just as a legitimately decreed
