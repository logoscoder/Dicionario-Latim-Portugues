CHAPTER 9

Discipulus Quantum volo explicasti vel
{*explicasti vel om. &NaRe} explicare curasti
opinionem praedictam. Ideo nunc incipe
allegare pro ipsa. aut primo {*aut primo:
Primo autem &NaPeRe} conare respondere
{*ostendere &NaPeRe} quod electores
quicunque summi pontificis sive {om. &Pe}
cardinales sive imperator sive aliqui {*alii
&NaMzPeRe} quicunque clerici vel laici si
efficerentur haeretici eo ipso essent privati iure
eligendi summum pontificem.

Student You have attended as much as I
want to an explanation of that opinion. Now,
therefore, begin to bring forward arguments
for it. First, however, try to show that if any
electors of the supreme pontiff, whether
cardinals, the emperor or any other clerics or
laymen, were to become heretics, they would
by that fact be deprived of the right to elect
the supreme pontiff.

Magister Hoc videtur multipliciter {non &Pe}
posse probari. Primo sic: illi qui non sunt de
corpore ecclesiae {om. &Pe} non possunt
eligere caput ecclesiae quia caput ecclesiae a
membro vel membris ecclesiae solummodo
eligi debet. Sed haeretici quicunque sive
{*fuerint add. &NaRe} cardinales sive alii non
sunt de corpore ecclesiae quia omnes haeretici
per haeresim exeunt ecclesiam, teste beato
Cypriano qui, ut legitur 1, q. 1, c. Si quis, ait,
"Si quis de ecclesia haeretica praesumptione
{eximi add. &Na} [[unclear]] exierit a
semetipso damnatus est." Ergo haeretici non
habent ius eligendi summum pontificem.

Master This seems provable in many ways.
First as follows: those who are not [part] of
the body of the church can not elect the head
of the church, because the head of the church
should be chosen only by a member or
members of the church. But no heretics,
whether they were cardinals or others, are
[part] of the body of the church, because all
heretics depart from the church because of
their heresy. Blessed Cyprian attests to this
when he says, as we read in 1, q. 1, c. Si quis
[c. 70, col.382, "If anyone departs from the
church with heretical presumption, he himself
condemns himself." Therefore heretics do not
have the right to elect the supreme pontiff.

Amplius illi {*ille &NaRe} cui {quibus &Pe}
catholici per praeceptum iuris Dei {*Domini
&NaPeRe} communicari {*communicare
&NaRe} non debent non habent {*habet &Re}
ius eligendi summum pontificem, quia
electoribus summi pontificis communicare
tenentur catholici quomodo {quem &Pe}
elegerunt {legerint &Re} {*elegerint &Na}
audiendo. Sed haereticis per praeceptum iuris
Dei {*domini &NaPeRe} catholici
communicare non debent, teste beato Paulo qui
ad Titum {ad Titum: actuum &Pe} tertio [:10]
ait, "Haereticum hominem post primam et
secundam correctionem {*correptionem
&NaVg} devita." Et beatus Iohannes {*in add.
&Pe} canonica sua {*2 add. &Mz} [:10-11]
{*etiam add. &Re} {et add. &Na} {2 c. add.
&Pe} ait, "Si quis venit ad vos et hanc

Further, he with whom, by the teaching of the
law of the Lord, catholics ought not to
communicate does not have the right to elect
the supreme pontiff, because catholics are
bound to communicate with the electors of
the supreme pontiff by listening to how they
have chosen. But by the teaching of the law
of the Lord catholics ought not communicate
with heretics. Blessed Paul attests to this
when he says in Titus 3:10, "After a first and
second admonition have nothing more to do
with anyone who is a heretic." And blessed
John also says in his second letter [2 John
2:10-11], "Do not receive into the house or
welcome anyone who comes to you and does
not bring this teaching; for to welcome is to
participate in the evil deeds of such a person."
As we read in 24, q. 1, c. Omnis [c. 24, col.
