susceperat auctor erroris". In his auctoritatibus inter
incidentem in haeresim pertinaciter et non pertinaciter
isti summi pontifices non distinguunt, et tamen
indiffinite
et
universaliter
dicunt
sectatores
haereticorum simili sententiae subiacere. Ergo superflue
ponitur in diffinitione praedicta "pertinaciter".

error, together with his successors, had received by
agreement of the synod". In these texts these supreme
pontiffs do not distinguish between those who fall into
heresy pertinaciously and not pertinaciously, and yet
they say indefinitely and universally that the followers
of heretics lie under a like sentence. Therefore
"pertinaciously" is superfluous in the definition above.

Item, Hieronymus super Epistolam ad Galatas, et
ponitur 24, q. 3, c. Haeresis, ait: "Quicunque igitur
aliter scripturam intelligit quam sensus Spiritus Sancti
flagitat (a quo scripta est), licet ab ecclesia non
recesserit, tamen haereticus appellari potest, et de carnis
operibus est eligens quae peiora sunt". Ex his verbis
patet quod omnis intelligens, sive pertinaciter sive non
pertinaciter, scripturam aliter quam sensus Spiritus
Sancti flagitat est haereticus. Ergo "pertinaciter"
inconvenienter ponitur in diffinitione praedicta.

Also, Jerome says, commenting upon the Epistle to the
Galatians (included in 24, q. 3, c. Haeresis [col. 997]):
"Therefore, whoever understands Scripture otherwise
than as the sense of the Holy Spirit demands (by whom
it is written), though he does not withdraw from the
Church, can nevertheless be called a heretic, and he is
choosing from among fleshly works those which are
worse". From these words it is clear that everyone,
whether pertinaciously or not pertinaciously,
understanding otherwise than as the sense of the Holy
Spirit demands is a heretic. Therefore "pertinaciously"
is unsuitably put in the above definition.

Item, Stephanus papa, inter dubium pertinacem et non
pertinacem non distinguens indiffinite dicit, ut habetur
Extra, De haereticis, c. 1 [col. 778]: "Dubius in fide
infidelis est". Ergo omnis dubitans de fide, sive
pertinaciter sive non pertinaciter, infidelis, et per
consequens haereticus, est censendus. Magis autem est
errare quam dubitare. Ergo omnis errans contra fidem,
sive pertinaciter sive non pertinaciter, hereticus est
censendus.

Also, Pope Stephen, not distinguishing between
pertinacious and not pertinacious doubt, says
indefinitely, as we read in Extra, De hereticis, c. 1:
"One who is doubtful in faith is unfaithful". Therefore
everyone who doubts about the faith, whether
pertinaciously or not pertinaciously, should be
considered unfaithful and consequently a heretic. [See
Significant Variants, para. 10.] But it is a bigger thing
to err than to doubt; therefore everyone who errs
against the faith, whether pertinaciously or not
pertinaciously, should be considered a heretic.

Item, Nicholaus papa, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Aperte,
indiffinite dicit, "Neminem deicere vel removere poterat
qui, talia praedicans, in fide titubat". Ex quibus verbis
colligitur quod omnis titubans seu dubitans in fide omni
potestate ecclesiastica est privatus, sed non nisi quia
hereticus; ergo omnis talis titubans seu dubitans in fide,
sive pertinaciter sive non pertinaciter, hereticus est
censendus. Ex quo sequitur quod omnis errans contra
fidem etiam non pertinaciter haereticus est censendus.

Also, Pope Nicholas, as we read in 24, q. 1, c. Aperte,
says indefinitely: "He who, preaching such things, is
unsteady in the faith was not able to depose or remove
anyone". From these words we gather that everyone
who is unsteady in faith is deprived of all ecclesiastical
power. But this is only because he is a heretic.
Therefore everyone who is unsteady or doubtful in
faith, whether pertinaciously or not pertinaciously,
should be considered a heretic. From this it follows that
everyone who errs against the faith, even not
pertinaciously, should be reckoned a heretic.

His concordat Gratianus 24, q. 1, para. His
auctoritatibus, dicens: "His auctoritatibus perspicue
monstratur quod, ex quo aliquis contra fidem ceperit
aliqua docere, nec deiicere aliquem valet nec damnare";
et per consequens talis docens contra fidem, quamvis
non fuerit convictus, est haereticus reputandus.

Gratian agrees with these. In 24, q. 1, para. His
auctoritatibus [col.981], he says: "By these texts it is
clearly shown that as soon as someone begins to teach
something against the faith he cannot depose or
condemn anyone", and consequently such a person
teaching against the faith, even if not convicted, should
be regarded as a heretic.

Item, fides quae non est firma non est vera fides. Hinc
dicit concilium generale, ut habetur Extra, De summa
trinitate et fide catholica, c. 1, "Firmiter credimus",
aperte insinuans quod omnis Catholicus firmiter credere
debet. Hinc etiam in Symbolo Athanasii continetur:
"Haec est fides Catholica quam nisi quisque fideliter
firmiterque crediderit salvus esse non poterit"; fides
ergo debet esse firma. Sed dubitans in fide, quamvis

Also, faith that is not firm is not true faith. Hence a
general council says, as we read Extra, De summa
trinitate et fide catholica, c. 1 [col.5], "We firmly
believe", obviously suggesting that every Catholic
should believe firmly. Hence also in the Athanasian
Creed it is contained: "This is the Catholic faith; unless
each one believes it faithfully and firmly, he cannot be
saved"; faith should therefore be firm. But one who
