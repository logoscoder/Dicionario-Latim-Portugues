Minor probatur, quia magis est haereticus reputandus
qui tenet haeresim damnatam explicite quam qui non
tenet doctrinam catholicam. Sed qui non tenet
doctrinam catholicam est haereticus quia vitandus, teste
beato Iohanne, qui in canonica sua secunda ait, "Si quis
venit ad vos et hanc doctrinam non affert, nolite eum
recipere in domum nec ave ei dixeritis. Qui enim dicit
illi ave communicat operibus illius malignis." Ex
quibus verbis patet quod qui non tenet doctrinam
catholicam est a fidelibus vitandus. Ergo qui tenet
haeresim damnatam explicite est vitandus. Sed nullus
propter haeresim, antequam sit haereticus, est vitandus.
Ergo qui tenet haeresim damnatam explicite est
haereticus.

The minor [premise] is proved because he who holds
an explicitly condemned heresy should more be
regarded as a heretic than he who does not hold to
catholic teaching. But he who does not hold to
catholic teaching is a heretic because he should be
avoided. Blessed John testifies to this, saying in his
second letter (2 John 1: 10-11): "If any man come to
you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into
the house nor say to him, 'God speed you.' For he that
saith unto him, 'God speed you', communicateth with
his wicked works." It is clear from these words that
he who does not hold to catholic teaching should be
avoided by the faithful. He who holds an explicitly
condemned heresy, therefore, should be avoided. But
no one should be avoided because of a heresy before
he is a heretic. He who holds an explicitly condemned
heresy, therefore, is a heretic.

Item quod dicta assertio sacris canonibus adversetur
ostenditur. Ait enim Gelasius papa, ut habetur 24, q. 1,
c. 1, "Quicunque in haeresim semel damnatam labitur
eius damnatione seipsum involvit." Ex quibus verbis
clare colligitur quod lapsus in haeresim damnatam
explicite est damnatus. Quod etiam idem Gelasius
eisdem causa et q. c. Maiores et Felix papa c. Achatius
secundo testantur aperte, sed damnatus propter
haeresim est haereticus. Ergo lapsus in haeresim
damnatam explicite est haereticus. Haereticus autem
tenetur statim suam haeresim revocare. Ergo tenens
haeresim damnatam explicite tenetur eam statim
revocare.

(ii) Again it is shown that the said assertion is
opposed to the sacred canons. For, as we find in 24, q.
1, c.1 [col.966], Pope Gelasius says: "Whoever falls
into a heresy that has once been condemned involves
himself in its condemnation." We clearly gather from
these words that he who has fallen into an explicitly
condemned heresy is condemned. Gelasius also in the
same causa and question, c. Maiores [col.966] and
Pope Felix c. Achatius "(2)" [col.966] clearly assert
this; but someone condemned because of heresy is a
heretic. He who has fallen into an explicitly
condemned heresy, therefore, is a heretic. A heretic,
however, is bound to retract his heresy immediately.
Someone holding an explicitly condemned heresy,
therefore, is bound to retract it immediately.

Hoc etiam per consuetudinem ecclesiae declaratur.
Nam inquisitores haereticae pravitatis, convicto
quocunque quod tenuerit haeresim damnatam explicite,
statim contra ipsum sicut contra haereticum
manifestum procedunt, et reputant ipsum haereticum
quamvis paratus sit corrigi. Si autem est haereticus,
tenetur suam haeresim revocare. Ergo, etc.

(iii) This is also made clear by the custom of the
church. For once anyone is convicted of holding an
explicitly condemned heresy, inquisitors into heretical
wickedness proceed against him immediately, as
against a manifest heretic, and regard him as a
heretic, even if he is ready to be corrected. If he is a
heretic, however, he is bound to retract his heresy.
Therefore, etc.

Hoc etiam ratione probatur. Nam si tenens haeresim
damnatam explicite non tenetur statim suam haeresim
revocare, hoc non est nisi quia valet se per ignorantiam
excusare, dicendo quod ignorat talem assertionem esse
explicite condemnatam. Sed talis ignorantia non
excusat, tum quia ignorantia iuris non excusat, ut
habetur 1. q. 4. para. Notandum, tum quia constitutio
apostolicae sedis omnes astringit postquam publicata
est nec aliquis post duos menses valet per ignorantiam
excusari, ut habetur Extra, De constitutionibus c. ultimo
et notat glossa eodem titulo super c. Cognoscentes.
Ergo consimiliter damnatio explicita omnes, saltem
post duos menses, astringit, tum quia in his quae
publice fiunt non potest quis ignorantiam allegare, ut ex

(iv) This is also proved by reason. For if someone
holding an explicitly condemned heresy is not bound
to retract his heresy immediately this is only because
he is able to excuse himself through ignorance by
saying that he does not know that such an assertion is
explicitly condemned. But such ignorance does not
excuse him (a) because ignorance of the law does not
excuse, as we find in 1, q. 4, para. Notandum
[col.422] and (b) because after a constitution of the
apostolic see has been published it is binding on
everyone and after two months no one can be excused
through ignorance, as we find in the last Chapter of
Extra, De constitutionibus [col.16] and as the gloss on
the chapter Cognoscentes of the same title [col.15]
