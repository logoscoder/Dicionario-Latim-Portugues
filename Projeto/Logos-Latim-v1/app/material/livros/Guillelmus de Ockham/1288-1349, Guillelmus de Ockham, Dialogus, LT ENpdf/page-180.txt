pope but about the church militant, "I am with you
always to the end of the age."

Item Christus non solum intellexit se permansurum
cum ecclesia militante usque ad consummacionem
seculi per fidem solummodo, sed eciam per caritatem
et bonam vitam. Constat autem quod Christus sepe non
est cum papa per caritatem et bonam vitam, cum sepe
papa sit vir nepharius extra caritatem existens. Ergo de
papa non debent predicta verba intelligi.

Again Christ did not mean that he would remain with
the church militant to the end of the age only through
faith but also through love and a good life. It is
certain, however, that Christ is often not with the pope
in love and a good life since the pope is often a
wicked man without love. The above words,
therefore, should not be understood of the pope.

Nec secunda auctoritas de papa debet intelligi ut
Christus rogaverit quod fides pape non deficeret, tum
quia sepe sedes apostolica vacat et tamen tunc non
deficit fides pro qua Christus rogavit, tum quia papa
potest renunciare papatui vel deponi et postea contra
fidem errare, et tamen nullo tempore deficiet fides pro
qua Christus rogavit. Verba ergo predicta dixit Christus
beato Petro pro persona ipsius Petri, quia finaliter fides
Petri non defecit, licet ad tempus defecerit, propter
quod dixit sibi Christus, "Et tu aliquando conversus",
postquam scilicet fides tua defecerit et tu ad fidem
redieris, "confirma fratres tuos." Eadem eciam verba,
scilicet, "Ego pro te rogavi ut non deficiat fides tua"
dixit Christus Petro pro congregacione fidelium, quia
fides Petri fuit et est in congregacione fidelium absque
interrupcione usque ad finem seculi duratura. Nam
fides quam beatus Petrus tenuit, predicavit et docuit
nequaquam deficiet, sed in aliquibus Christianis,
clericis vel laicis, viris vel mulieribus, usque ad finem
seculi permanebit.

Nor should the second text be understood of the pope
as though Christ asked that the pope's faith should not
fail. This is firstly because the apostolic see is often
vacant and yet the faith for which Christ asked does
not then fail, and secondly because a pope can
renounce the papacy or be deposed and afterwards err
against faith, and yet at no time will the faith for
which Christ asked fail. Christ said the aforesaid
words to blessed Peter, therefore, in reference to Peter
himself, because in the end Peter's faith did not fail,
although it did fail for a time, which is why Christ
said to him, "And thou, being once converted", that is,
after your faith has failed and you have turned back to
the faith, "confirm thy brethren." Christ also said
those words, that is, "But I have prayed for the that
thy faith fail not", to Peter representing the
congregation of the faithful, because Peter's faith did
and will endure without interruption in the
congregation of the faithful to the end of the age. For
the faith that blessed Peter held, preached and taught
will not fail but will persist in some Christians, cleric
or lay, men or women, to the end of the age.

Decimaquinta racio eorum est hec: qui potest
hereticorum et heresis fautor et defensor existere potest
heretica pravitate fedari, ymmo talis heresiarcha est
censendus, teste Urbano papa qui ut habetur 24, q. 3, c.
Qui aliorum ait, "Qui aliorum errorem defendit multo
dampnabilior est illis qui errant, quia non solum ille
errat sed eciam aliis offendicula erroris preparat et
confirmat. Unde quia magister erroris est non tantum
hereticus sed eciam heresiarcha dicendus est." Sed
papa potest hereticorum et pravitatis heretice fautor et
defensor existere, secundum quod per duo exempla
probatur. Primum est de Anastasio secundo, qui fuit
fautor Fotini et Achacii hereticorum, secundum quod
habetur dist. 19, c. Anastasius. Secundum exemplum
ponunt aliqui de Iohanne 22, qui Nicolai Tercii et
decretalis sue que incipit, Exiit qui seminat, necnon et
Clementis V et decretalis sue que incipit, Exivi de
Paradiso, fautor fuit aliquando et defensor; et tamen in
dictis decretalibus Exiit et Exivi plures hereses de
paupertate Christi et apostolorum eius necnon et de
voto abdicacionis proprietatis omnium temporalium in
speciali et etiam in communi liquido continentur, ut
nonnulli dicunt et scribunt.

Their fifteenth argument is this. Whoever can be a
supporter and defender of heretics and heresy can be
stained with heretical wickedness. Indeed, such a
person should be considered a heresiarch according to
the testimony of Pope Urban, who says, as we find in
24, q. 3, c. Qui aliorum [col.999], "Whoever defends
an error of others is more culpable than those who err
because not only does he err himself but he also
prepares and confirms stumbling blocks of error for
others. So because he is a teacher of error he should
be called not only a heretic but also a heresiarch." But
a pope can be a supporter and defender of heretics and
heretical wickedness, as is proved by two examples.
The first concerns Anastasius II who was a supporter
of the heretics Fotinus and Achacius, as we find in
dist. 19, c. Anastasius [col.64]. Some people give as a
second example John XXII who was at one time a
supporter and defender of Nicholas III and his
decretal Exiit qui seminat and also of Clement V and
his decretal Exivi de paradiso; and yet some people
say and write that in those decretals Exiit and Exivi
there are clearly contained many errors about the
poverty of Christ and his apostles and also about a
