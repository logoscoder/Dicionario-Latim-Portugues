recessisse videatur." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi
quod secundum beatum Hieronymum haeresis sine
perverso dogmate contrario doctrinae ecclesiae minime
invenitur. Quare verba Hieronimi cum dicit, "Haeresis
autem Graece ab electione", etc, de electione non
cuiuscunque disciplinae sed disciplinae falsae
contrariae disciplinae ecclesiae debent intelligi et non
debent intelligi de electione actuali sed etiam magis
potentiali qua quis potest disciplinam falsam
contrariam disciplinae ecclesiae eligere quam putat
meliorem.

episcopal separation.... but there is no schism unless
someone invents some heresy for himself, with the
result that he rightly seems to have withdrawn from
the church." We are given to understand by these
words that according to blessed Jerome heresy is not
found without wrong teaching contrary to the teaching
of the church. Therefore Jerome's words, when he
says, "Heresy [is taken] from the Greek for choice"
etc, should be understood not of any teaching at all
but of false teaching contrary to the teaching of the
church and should not be understood of an actual
choice but more of a potential [choice] by which
someone can choose a false teaching which is contrary
to the teaching of the church [but] which he thinks is
better.

Chapter 12

Discipulus Video quod verba Hieronymi sic intellecta
praedictae descriptioni haeresis non repugnant. Ex qua
sequi videtur quod omnes assertiones quae Scripturae
Sacrae quomodolibet adversantur sunt inter haereses
computandae, sed an omnes christiani hoc sentiant et
affirment ignoro. Quare si aliqui hoc non sentiunt
nequaquam occultes.

Student I see that understood in this way Jerome's
words do not oppose the above description of heresy.
It seems to follow from this that all assertions which
are in any way at all opposed to sacred scripture
should be counted among the heresies, but I do not
know whether all christians think and affirm this. Do
not conceal it, therefore, if some people do not think
this.

Magister Fuerunt Manichaei qui vetus testamentum
minime receperunt; aliqui etiam haeretici multa in
novo testamento respuerunt.

Master There were the Manichees who did not accept
the Old Testament; some heretics have also rejected
many things in the New Testament.

Discipulus Illi de quibus nunc loqueris fuerunt
haeretici ab ecclesia condemnati, de quibus non curo
audire. Sed libenter cognoscerem an sint aliqui
catholici vel aliqui ab ecclesia nullatenus condemnati
qui non reputent omnes assertiones haereticas quae
Sacrae Scripturae quomodolibet adversantur.

Student Those about whom you are now speaking
were condemned as heretics by the church and I do
not care to hear about them. But I would willingly
learn whether there are any catholics or any people
not condemned by the church who do not regard as
heretical all assertions that are in any way opposed to
sacred scripture.

Magister Sunt quidam moderni dicentes quod multae
sunt assertiones quae in rei veritate adversantur
Scripturae Divinae quia tamen ab ecclesia minime sunt
condemnatae non sunt inter haereses numerandae,
quemadmodum multae sunt veritates consonae
Scripturae Divinae quae, quia tamen non sunt per
ecclesiam diffinitae vel determinatae, non sunt inter
veritates catholicas computandae. Sed postquam
assertiones Scripturae Divinae contrariae fuerunt per
summum pontificem condemnatae pro haeresibus sunt
habendae, et veritates consonae Scripturae Divinae
postquam fuerint per summum pontificem diffinitae
seu determinatae catholicae sunt censendae. Propter
quod dicunt quod papa potest facere novum articulum
fidei et eadem ratione potest facere quod assertio quae
prius non erat haereticalis postea per condemnationem
suam esse haereticalis incipiat.

Master There are some moderns who say that there
are many assertions which in truth of fact are opposed
to divine scripture and which should nevertheless not
be numbered among heresies because they have not
been condemned by the church, just as there are many
truths in harmony with divine scripture which
nevertheless should not be counted among catholic
truths because they have not been defined or
determined by the church. But after assertions
contrary to divine scripture have been condemned by
the highest pontiff they must be held to be heresies,
and after truths in harmony with divine scripture have
been defined or determined by the highest pontiff they
must be considered catholic. For this reason they say
that the pope can make a new article of faith and, by
the same argument, can bring it about that an assertion
which was not previously heretical begins to be
heretical after his condemnation.
