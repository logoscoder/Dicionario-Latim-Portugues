Capitulum 3

Chapter 3.

Discipulus Distinctionem inter scienter pertinacem
et nescienter pertinacem et similiter inter scienter
haereticum et nescienter haereticum modo aliter
quam prius intelligo, et ideo quamvis prius
putaverim nullum esse scienter pertinacem aut
scienter haereticum, nunc mihi videtur quod omnis
pertinax in errore et omnis haereticus est scienter
pertinax et scienter haereticus et nullus penitus
nescienter Quod potest tali ratione probari. Ad hoc
quod aliquis sit catholicus et fidelis sufficit fides
implicita. Hoc per exemplum de Cornelio centurione
de quo habetur Actuum 10 c. patere videtur. Qui
antequam de Christo fidem haberet explicitam fuit
fidelis quia iustus et timens Deum et per consequens
fidem habuit saltem implicitam. Et ita fides implicita
sufficit ad hoc quod aliquis sit catholicus et fidelis.
Sed quicunque non est scienter pertinax neque
scienter haereticus modo praeexposito habet fidem
implicitam quia, ex hoc ipso quod non putat se errare
contra fidem Christianam, credit totam fidem
Christianam esse veram, licet in aliquo speciali erret.
Qui autem credit totam fidem Christianam veram
habet fidem implicitam. Ergo est catholicus et fidelis
et per consequens non est pertinax neque haereticus.
Confirmatur haec ratio quia qui credit totam fidem
Christianam esse veram habet fidem de omni veritate
pertinente ad fidem Christianam; qui autem habet
fidem de omni veritate pertinente ad fidem
Christianam non est haereticus et per consequens
non est pertinax. Sed quicunque non est scienter
pertinax neque scienter haereticus credit totam fidem
Christianam esse veram; ergo habet fidem de omni
veritate pertinente ad fidem Christianam, et per
consequens nullo modo est haereticus nec pertinax.

Disciple Now I understand differently from before the
distinction between a knowingly pertinacious and an
unknowingly pertinacious person and likewise [the
distinction] between a knowingly heretical and an
unknowingly heretical person. And therefore although I
thought before that no one was knowingly pertinacious
or knowingly a heretic, now it seems to me that
everyone pertinacious in error and every heretic is
knowingly pertinacious and knowingly a heretic and
absolutely no one is unknowingly so. This can be proved
by the following argument. For someone to be catholic
and faithful it is enough that he has implicit faith. This
seems to be clear from the example of the centurion
Cornelius, about whom we read in Acts 10. He was
faithful before he had explicit faith concerning Christ
because he was just and feared God and as a result did
have at least implicit faith. And thus implicit faith
suffices for someone to be catholic and faithful. But
whoever is not knowingly pertinacious or knowingly a
heretic in the way set out earlier has implicit faith
because, from the fact that he does not think that he is
erring against the christian faith, he believes that the
whole christian faith is true even if he errs in some
particular. Now he who believes that the whole christian
faith is true has implicit faith. He is, therefore, catholic
and faithful and as a result is neither pertinacious nor a
heretic. This argument is confirmed because he who
believes that the whole christian faith is true has faith in
every truth pertaining to the christian faith; he who has
faith in every truth pertaining to the christian faith,
however, is not a heretic and as a result is not
pertinacious. But whoever is not knowingly pertinacious
nor knowingly a heretic believes that the whole christian
faith is true; he has faith, therefore, in every truth
pertaining to christian faith and consequently is in no
way a heretic or pertinacious.

Magister Istae obiectiones principaliter inducuntur
ad probandum quod nullus est nescienter haereticus.

Master Those objections are brought forward mainly to
prove that no one is unknowingly a heretic.

Discipulus Ita est.

Disciple That is so.

Magister Dimittamus ergo loqui de pertinace et
sufficiat de haeretico facere mentionem.

Master Let us therefore put aside speaking about
someone pertinacious and let it be enough to talk about a
heretic.

Discipulus Placet quia qui potest videre quomodo
quis potest esse nescienter haereticus non dubitabit
quin valebit quis esse pertinax nescienter.

Disciple This is acceptable because he who can see how
anyone can be unknowingly a heretic will not doubt that
someone will be able to be unknowingly pertinacious.

Magister De nescienter haeretico distinguitur.
Quidam enim sunt vel esse possunt nescienter
haeretici quia scienter et explicite arbitrantur aliquas
assertiones sub forma propria scriptas in scriptura

Master A distinction is made among those who are
unknowingly heretics. For some people are or can be
unknowingly heretics because they knowingly and
explicitly think that some assertions written in divine
