castitatem quam moniales vovent non esse altiorem
castitate coniugali, deberet papa tam asserentem
pertinaciter quam assertionem damnare. Sic quidam
errores negantes Fratres Praedicatores et Minores posse
audire confessiones sunt damnati. Sic summi pontifices
Alexander 4 et Innocentius 4 quosdam magistros
Parisienses et errores eorum contra statum et vitam
Praedicatorum et Minorum solenniter damnaverunt.

manifest heresy. If someone were to say, therefore,
that the chastity vowed by nuns is not more noble than
conjugal chastity, the pope ought to condemn both the
one asserting this pertinaciously and the assertion.
Certain errors denying that the preaching friars and
the friars minor can hear confessions have been
condemned in this way. The highest pontiffs
Alexander IV and Innocent IV solemnly condemned
in this way certain Parisian masters and their errors
against the state and life of [the Orders of] preachers
and minorites.

Capitulum 34

Chapter 34

Discipulus Haec probabilia mihi videntur, sed
videturne aliquibus quod liceat alicui alii inferiori papa
errores huiusmodi condemnare?

Student These seem probable to me, but does it seem
to some people that it is licit for someone else inferior
to the pope to condemn errors of this kind?

Magister Sunt quidam dicentes quod hoc inferiori
papa non licet quia, ex quo non licet eis damnare
haereses, quae magis quam quicunque alii errores
religioni adversantur et nocent christianae, multo
fortius non licet eis errores alios condemnare. Et haec
ratio videtur confirmari. Nam maiori periculo est
fortius resistendum; sed haereses sunt magis
periculosae fidei christianae quam alii errores; cui ergo
non licet haereses condemnare de aliis erroribus se
intromittere minime debet.

Master There are some people who say that this is not
licit for anyone inferior to the pope because, since it is
not licit for them to condemn heresies, which are
opposed to and harm the christian religion more than
any other errors, it is much more the case that it is not
licit for them to condemn other errors. And this
argument seems to be confirmed. For a greater danger
should be resisted more stoutly; but heresies are more
dangerous to the christian faith than are other errors;
he who is not permitted to condemn heresies,
therefore, should not involve himself in other errors.

Alii autem dicunt quod inferioribus praelatis licet
errores huiusmodi condemnare. Pro hac assertione sic
arguitur. Quod aliquando licuit praelatis inferioribus et
non est per summum pontificem nec per generale
concilium revocatum adhuc licet eisdem; sed damnare
errores huiusmodi licuit aliquando praelatis aliis et non
est revocatum; ergo etc. Maior est patens. Minor
probatur. Nam cui licet veritates aliquas approbare
eidem licet assertiones falsas contrarias reprobare. Sed
quondam licuit praelatis inferioribus veritatem
asserentem aliquem esse sanctum et tanquam sanctum
venerandum a fidelibus approbare quia licuit eis
sanctos novos catalogo sanctorum asscribere. Ergo
licuit eis assertionem falsam quod tales non essent
sancti nec venerandi a fidelibus reprobare et solenniter
condemnare. Ergo adhuc licet eis errores aliquos
condemnare.

Other people say, however, that it is licit for inferior
prelates to condemn errors of this kind. They argue as
follows for this assertion. What has been licit for
inferior prelates at any time and has not been revoked
by the highest pontiff or by a general council is still
licit for them; but it was once licit for other prelates to
condemn errors of this kind, and this has not been
revoked; therefore, etc. The major [premise] is clear;
the minor [premise] is proved. For it is licit for anyone
who is permitted to approve some truths to reject
opposing false assertions. But it has sometimes been
licit for inferior prelates to approve someone asserting
a truth as holy, and as worthy of veneration as being
holy by believers, because it has been licit for them to
enter new saints in the catalogue of saints. Therefore it
has been licit for them to reject and solemnly to
condemn a false assertion that such people were not
saints and should not be venerated by believers. It is,
therefore, still licit for them to condemn some errors.

Discipulus Ista ratio non videtur concludere contra
istos, quia probat tantummodo quod aliquando licuit
eis errorem dicentem talem non esse sanctum
condemnare. Sed modo non licet eis talem errorem
damnare, sicut nec modo licet eis aliquem catalogo
sanctorum asscribere.

Student That argument does not seem to be
conclusive against them because it proves only that it
was at some time licit for them to condemn the error
that says that such a person is not a saint. But it is not
now licit for them to condemn such an error, just as it
is not now licit for them to enter anyone into the
catalogue of saints.
