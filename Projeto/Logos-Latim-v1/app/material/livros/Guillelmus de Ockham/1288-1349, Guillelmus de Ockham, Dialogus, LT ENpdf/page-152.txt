qui catholicae veritati resistit et credit haereticae
pravitati quam qui non acquiescit veritati et credit
iniquitati. Qui autem non acquiescit veritati et credit
iniquitati peccat mortaliter, teste Apostolo ad
Romanos 2, qui ait, "His autem qui sunt ex
contentione et qui non acquiescunt veritati credunt
autem inquitati ira et indignatio, tribulatio et angustia."
Ergo qui catholice veritati resistit et credit haereticae
pravitati peccat mortaliter, sed non sine pertinacia.
Ergo talis pertinax et haereticus est censendus.

who resists catholic truth and believes heretical
wickedness does not sin any less than he who does not
assent to the truth and believes in iniquity; he who
does not assent to the truth and believes in iniquity,
however, sins mortally, as the Apostle attests when he
says in Romans 2:[8-9], "But to them that are
contentious and who obey not the truth, but give credit
to iniquity [there will come] wrath and indignation,
tribulation and anguish"; he who resists catholic truth
and believes heretical wickedness, therefore, sins
mortally, but not without pertinacity; such a person
should be considered, therefore, pertinacious and a
heretic.

Amplius, Christiani qui propter persecutionem quam
inferunt defendentibus catholicam veritatem et
impugnantibus haereticam pravitatem sunt peiores his
qui carnali immundicia sunt infecti sunt pertinaces et
haeretici reputandi, quia pravitas peccati eorum ad
aliud genus peccati quam infidelitatis, heresis vel
pertinaciae reduci non potest. Sed Christiani
persequentes illos qui veritatem catholicam defensare
nituntur et pravitatem haereticam satagunt impugnare
sunt peiores peccatis carnalibus maculatis, quia non
sunt minus mali quam illi qui praedicatores veritatis
audire recusant; qui tamen recusantes veritatis
praedicatores audire peiores sunt illis qui peccatis
carnis sunt infecti, veritate ipsa testante, quae ait
praedicatoribus evangelicae veritatis Matthaei 10 c.,
"Quicunque non receperit vos nec audierit sermones
vestros, exeuntes foras de domo vel civitate excutite
pulverem de pedibus vestris. Amen dico vobis
tolerabilius erit terrae Sodomorum et Gomorreorum in
die iudicii quam illi civitati." Ergo qui declarationem
catholicae veritatis et detectionem haereticae pravitatis
impediunt pertinaces et haeretici sunt censendi.

[See Significant Variants, para. 23.] Furthermore,
Christians who are worse than those corrupted by
carnal impurity because of the persecution they inflict
on those defending catholic truth and opposing
heretical wickedness should be regarded as
pertinacious and heretics because the wickedness of
their sin can not be reduced to any other kind of sin
except lack of faith, heresy or pertinacity; but
christians persecuting those who try to defend catholic
truth and attempt to oppose heretical depravity are
worse than those stained with carnal sins; this is
because they are not less evil than those who refuse to
listen to preachers of the truth; those who refuse to
listen to preachers of the truth are in turn worse than
those who have been corrupted by carnal sins. The
Truth Himself testifies to this when he says, in
Matthew 10:[14-5], to preachers of the Gospel truth,
"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your
words, going forth out of that house or city shake off
the dust from your feet. Amen I say to, it shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the
day of judgement than for that city." Those who
prevent the disclosure of catholic truth and the
uncovering of heretical depravity, therefore, should be
considered pertinacious and heretics.

Discipulus Ista ratio non videtur apparentiam habere
nisi de apostolis et praedicatoribus miracula
facientibus, quia veritas ipsa apostolis facturis
miracula loquebatur. Et ideo qui impugnaret veritatem
catholicam defendentes et pravitatem haereticam
reprobantes quorum sermones et assertiones Deus
miraculis confirmaret esset peior enormibus
peccatoribus iudicandus, non autem qui impugnat alios
miracula minime facientes.

Student That argument does not seem to have a show
of truth except in reference to apostles and preachers
performing miracles, because the Truth himself was
speaking to the apostles as they were going to perform
miracles. Anyone who would oppose those defenders
of catholic truth or disapprovers of heretical
wickedness whose words and assertions God would
confirm with miracles, therefore, should be judged as
worse than outrageous sinners; this is not so, however,
of anyone who opposes others not performing
miracles.

Magister Istam obiectionem sive responsionem alii
evacuare conantur, dicentes quod non minoris
auctoritatis est confirmatio veritatis catholicae per
Scripturam Sacram quam per operationem miraculi, ita
ut qui non credit Scripturae Divinae nec operationi

Master Others try to counter that objection or reply by
saying that the confirmation of catholic truth through
sacred scripture is of no less authority than
[confirmation] through the performing of a miracle, so
that he who does not believe divine scripture does not
