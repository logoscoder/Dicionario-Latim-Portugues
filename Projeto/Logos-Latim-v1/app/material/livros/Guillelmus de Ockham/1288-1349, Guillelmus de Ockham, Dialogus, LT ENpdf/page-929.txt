Magister Circa hoc sunt diversae opiniones
{*assertiones &NaRe} {*trs. &NaRe}. Una est
quae {*quod &NaMzPeRe} revertitur ad
imperatorem Romanorum. Cuius ratio
assignatur quoniam {*quia &NaRe} quando
aliqui electores {*trs. &MzNaRe} privantur
iure eligendi electio revertitur ad illum vel
{*illum vel om. &NaRe} illos qui ante
immediate habuerunt ius eligendi summum
pontificem {*summum pontificem om.
&NaMzPeRe}; sed antequam {*ante &NaRe}
cardinales qui post imperatorem {*imperatores
&NaMzPeRe} habuerunt ius eligendi,
immediate habuit imperator {*trs.312
&MzNaPeRe} ius eligendi summum
pontificem. igitur {*Ergo &MzNaRe} si
cardinales propter haereticam pravitatem
privantur iure eligendi Romanum episcopum,
ius eligendi revertitur ad imperatorem.

Master Various assertions are made about
this. One is that it reverts to the emperor of
the Romans. The reason given for this is that
when some electors are deprived of their right
to elect, the election reverts to those who had
the right to elect immediately before; but
before the cardinals, who had the right to
elect after the emperors, the emperor directly
had the right to elect the supreme pontiff. If
the cardinals are deprived because of
heretical wickedness of their right to elect the
Roman bishop, therefore, the right to elect
reverts to the emperor.

Alia assertio est quod si cardinales efficiantur
haeretici et non {om. &Mz} sit {om. &Pe}
papa qui de electoribus valeat ordinare, ius
eligendi {ecclesie &Mz} revertitur ad
canonicos ecclesiae ubi est sedes papae, quia
{qui &Pe} cessante privilegio recurrendum est
ad ius commune; sed cardinales non habent ius
eligendi nisi ex privilegio speciali. igitur
{*Ergo &MzNaRe} si privilegium illud
propter pravitatem haereticam {*trs.
&MzNaPeRe} perdiderint {*perdiderunt
&NaRe} recurrendum est ad ius commune. Est
autem ius {om. &Pe} commune quod canonici
ecclesiarum cathedralium {*trs. &MzNaRe}
habent ius eligendi episcopos. igitur {*Ergo
&MzNaRe} in hoc casu ad canonicos ecclesiae
ubi est sedes papae revertitur ius eligendi
summum pontificem.

Another assertion is that if the cardinals
become heretics and there is no pope who can
make arrangements about electors, the right
to elect reverts to the canons of the church
where the pope's see is, because when a
privilege ceases there should be recourse to
the common law; but the cardinals have the
right to elect only by a special privilege. If
they have lost that privilege because of
heretical wickedness, therefore, recourse
should be had to the common law. The
common law, however, is that the canons of
cathedral churches have the right to elect
bishops. In this case, therefore, the right to
elect the supreme pontiff reverts to the
canons of the church where the pope's see is.

Alia est assertio quod in hoc casu electio
summi pontificis {*revertitur /revolvitur Pe\
vel add. &MzNaPeRe} devolvitur ad totum
clerum Romanam {*Romanum &NaMzPeRe},
quia quod soli clerici cathedralis ecclesiae
habent {*habeant &MzNaRe} [[habent:
margin Re]] ius eligendi summum pontificem
{*summum pontificem: episcopum &NaRe}

Another assertion is that in this case the
election of the supreme pontiff reverts to or
devolves upon the whole Roman clergy,
because it is by a special privilege that only
the clerics of the cathedral church have the
right to elect their bishop; the common law,
however, is that the whole clergy have the
right to elect. Because the right to elect the
