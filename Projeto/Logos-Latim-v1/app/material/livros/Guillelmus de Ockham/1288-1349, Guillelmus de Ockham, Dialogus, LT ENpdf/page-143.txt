Magister Dicunt quod si millesies defenderet
haeresim nescienter cum protestatione expressa vel
tacita quod paratus est corrigi cum cognoverit
opinionem suam catholicae fidei obviare etiam coram
papa non esset haereticus iudicandus nisi per alia
legitima documenta haereticus probaretur quia, sicut
prima vice licet sibi nescienter tali modo opinionem
erroneam defendere, ita licet secunda vice et tertia et
semper quousque fuerit sibi probatum aperte quod sua
opinio est inter haereses computanda.

Master They say that if he were to defend
unknowingly a heresy a thousand times, even before
the pope, with an explicit or tacit declaration that he is
ready to be corrected when he learns that his opinion
conflicts with catholic faith, he should not be judged a
heretic unless he were proved to be a heretic by other
legitimate proofs because, just as it is licit for him to
defend an erroneous opinion unknowingly in this way
the first time, so it is licit a second time and a third,
and always until it has been clearly proved to him that
his opinion should be reckoned among the heresies.

Discipulus Forte dicet taliter opinionem suam
defendens, etiam postquam opinio sua fuerit probata
haeretica, quod non est sibi ostensum quod sua opinio
fidei obviat orthodoxae, et ita nunquam posset
convinci.

Disciple Perhaps someone defending his opinion in
this way will say, even after his opinion has been
proved heretical, that it has not been shown to him that
his opinion conflicts with orthodox faith, and so he
could never be convicted.

Magister Non sufficit sibi negare opinionem suam
esse probatam haereticam, sed cogetur stare iudicio
peritorum; qui, si reputaverint sufficienter esse sibi
probatum quod opinio sua est haeretica, tenetur eam
revocare, alioquin inter pertinaces et haereticos est
censendus.

Master It is not enough for him to deny that his
opinion has been proved heretical, but he will be
forced to stand by the judgement of the knowledgable.
If they think that it has been sufficiently proved to him
that his opinion is heretical, he is bound to retract it;
otherwise he should be considered among the
pertinacious and the heretics.

Discipulus Quid si errant periti et omnes theologiae
magistri una cum papa?

Disciple What if the knowledgable and all the masters
of theology, together with the pope, err?

Magister De facto damnabunt innocentem. Poterit
tamen secundum iura causam suam per remedium
appellationis sublevare. Si autem appellationi suae
legitimae non defertur, non restat ei nisi ut divinae
gratiae se committat et non timeat de hominum
societate iudicio iniquo deleri quem de libro viventium
conscientia non delet iniqua.

Master They will de facto condemn an innocent
person. Nevertheless, according to the laws he will be
able to assist his cause by the remedy of appeal. If his
legitimate appeal is not granted, however, nothing
remains for him but to commit himself to divine grace
and not to be afraid of being eliminated from human
society by an iniquitous judgement, because a bad
conscience does not blot him out of the book of the
living.

Discipulus Quid si in scriptis haeresim manifestam
defendit?

Disciple What if he defends an obvious heresy in
writing?

Magister Dicunt quod propter hoc nec pertinax nec
haereticus est reputandus, quia quantum ad hoc non
refert an verbo vel scripto opinionem erroneam teneat
vel defendat. Nam beatus Cyprianus opinionem
haereticam in scriptis reliquit, quia tamen eam
pertinaciter non defendit non fuit haereticus
iudicandus. Sic etiam abbas Ioachim opinionem
haereticam scripsit, sicut testatur Innocentius 3, Extra,
De summa trinitate et fide catholica, c. Damnamus, et
tamen non fuit haereticus iudicandus, glossa super
dicto c. Damnamus dicente de eodem Ioachim, "quia
paratus fuit corrigi et se correxit, ut sequitur non debet
dici haereticus, licet quandoque errasset in fide." Sic
etiam Petrus Iohannes, licet opiniones suae quas in

Master They say that he is not to be regarded as
pertinacious or a heretic on this account, because with
respect to this it does not matter whether he holds or
defends an erroneous opinion in speech or in writing.
For blessed Cyprian has left behind an heretical
opinion in his writings, yet because he did not defend
it pertinaciously he should not have been judged a
heretic. In the same way the abbot Joachim also wrote
an heretical opinion, as Innocent III testifies in Extra,
De summa trinitate et fide c. Damnamus [col.6], yet he
should not have been judged a heretic, as the gloss on
that chapter Damnamus says about Joachim, "that he
was ready to be corrected and did correct himself, so
that it follows that he ought not be called a heretic,
