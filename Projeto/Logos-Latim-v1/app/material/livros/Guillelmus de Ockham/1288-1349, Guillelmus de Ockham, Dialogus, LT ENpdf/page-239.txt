generali congregati, tum quia sepe Deus revelat parvulis
que a sapientibus et prudentibus absconduntur. Licet
ergo in generali concilio omnes errarent, et soli parvuli
et illiterati ad concilium minime convenirent, non esset
aliquatenus desperandum quin Deus veritatem
catholicam parvulis revelaret vel eisdem veritatem
notam defendere inspiraret. Hoc enim esset ad gloriam
Dei qui in hoc ostenderet fidem nostram non esse in
sapiencia hominum ad generale concilium vocatorum
sed in virtute Dei qui nonnumquam que stulta sunt
mundi eligit ut confundat sapientes. Nec propter
sanctitatem ad concilium generale vocatorum est
dicendum quod non possunt errare contra fidem, tum
quia interdum ad generale concilium sancciores
nequaquam conveniunt, tum quia sanctitas in ecclesia
militante nullos confirmat in fide. Nec propter tercium
est dicendum quod non possunt errare contra fidem quia
auctoritas vel potestas in hac vita nullos confirmat in
fide, sicut per auctoritates superius inductas, ubi
inquisitum est si papa potest contra fidem errare,
sufficienter videtur ostensum. Nec propter quartum,
quia Christus promittendo apostolis fidem usque ad
finem seculi duraturam de generali concilio nullam
penitus facit mencionem.

a general council who can defend the faith even if all
those gathered together in a general council were to
err, and because God often reveals to children what is
hidden from the wise and prudent. Even if all those in
a general council were to err, therefore, and only
children and the unlearned were not gathered in the
council, there should not be any lack of hope that
God would not reveal the catholic truth to the
children or inspire them to defend the known truth.
For this would be to the glory of God who would in
this way show that our faith does not rest on the
wisdom of humans gathered together in a general
council but on the strength of God who sometimes
chooses those who are foolish in the world to
confound the wise. Nor should it be said that those
called to a general council can not err on account of
their holiness, both because sometimes holier people
do not come together in a general council and
because holiness does not confirm anyone in the
church militant in faith. Nor should it be said that
they can not err against faith on account of the third
[reason] because authority or power in this life does
not confirm anyone in faith, as seems sufficiently
shown by the texts brought forward above where it
was asked whether the pope can err against faith. Nor
[should it be said] on account of the fourth [reason]
because in promising the apostles that the faith would
last until the end of the age, Christ made no mention
at all of a general council.

Capitulum 26

Chapter 26

Magister Secundo ostendunt exemplis quod generale
concilium potest contra fidem errare. Primum
exemplum est de synodo Stephani pape 7 que erronee
omnes ordinaciones factas per Formosum papam irritas
esse decrevit. Unde et postea synodo celebrata Ravenne
per Iohannem papam 9 extitit reprobata. Ergo concilium
generale potest errare, quia constat quod altera illarum
synodorum, quarum una alteram reprobavit, erravit.

Master: Secondly, they show by examples that a
general council can err against faith. The first
example is of a synod of Pope Stephen VII which
erroneously declared invalid all the ordinations
carried out by Pope Formosus. As a result, it [the
synod] was later condemned at a synod celebrated at
Ravenna by Pope John IX. A general council can err,
therefore, because it is certain that one of those
synods, one of which condemned the other, did err.

Discipulus Altera illarum synodorum erravit sed non
contra fidem, quia erravit tantummodo circa
ordinaciones Formosi pape.

Student: One of those synods erred, but not against
faith, because it erred only about the ordinations of
Pope Formosus.

Magister Hec responsio impugnatur quia omnis
congregacio que potest errare contra bonos mores potest
errare contra fidem, quia mali mores excecant
intellectum et ita qui potest peccare potest incidere in
errorem eciam contra fidem. Si ergo altera illarum
synodorum contra mores erravit, impie et inique
approbando vel reprobando ordinaciones factas per
Formosum papam, sequitur quod eciam poterat contra
fidem errare.

Master: This reply is attacked because every
congregation which can err against good morals can
err against faith, since bad morals blind the
understanding, and so he who can sin can also fall
into an error against faith. If one of those synods
erred against morals, therefore, by impiously and
wickedly approving or condemning ordinations
carried out by Pope Formosus, it follows that it was
also able to err against faith.

Discipulus Aliter potest responderi ad exemplum

Student: Another reply to the example just given is
