christiani et discipuli Christi fuerunt sub
imperatore, quantum ad iurisdictionem
coactivam, multipliciter videtur posse probari.
Nam religio christiana et per consequens
Christus neminem, eciam secularem et
infidelem, privavit iure suo. Sed apostoli
{*antequam essent apostoli add. &NaRe}
fuerunt subiecti imperatori et aliis potestatibus
secularibus et infidelibus; ergo postquam
fuerunt apostoli, fuerunt eisdem et in eisdem
subiecti.

the apostles and all other christians and
disciples of Christ were under the emperor, as
far as his coercive jurisdiction was
concerned. For the christian religion, and
consequently Christ, did not deprive anyone,
even someone secular and unbelieving, of his
right. But before they were apostles, the
apostles were subject to the emperor and
other secular and unbelieving powers; after
they were apostles, therefore, they were
subject to the same people and in the same
things.

Minor istius racionis videtur manifesta, quia
non plus erant apostoli ante conversionem et
apostolatum exempti a iurisdictione
imperatoris, quam alii Iudei, qui tamen erant
subiecti imperatori et aliis potestatibus
secularibus.

The minor [premise] of this argument seems
manifest, because before their conversion and
their apostolate the apostles were not more
exempt from the jurisdiction of the emperor
than were other jews; yet the latter were
subject to the emperor and other secular
powers.

Maior autem multis modis ostenditur. Ait enim
Ambrosius super epistolam ad Titum,
"Admone illos principibus et potestatibus
subditos esse, quasi etsi tu habes imperium
spirituale, tamen admone illos subditos esse
principibus, scilicet regibus et ducibus et
potestatibus minoribus, quia christiana religio
neminem privat iure suo."

The major [premise], however, is shown in
many ways. For Ambrose says on the letter to
Titus [P.L. 17, 530], "Admonish them to be
subject to princes and powers, as if, although
you have a spiritual empire, yet advise them
to be subject to princes, that is kings, dukes
and minor powers, because the christian
religion deprives no one of his right."

Item Augustinus super Iohannem ait, "Regnum
meum non est de hoc mundo, decepti estis, non
impedio dominacionem vestram in mundo, ne
vane timeatis et seviatis."

Again, writing on John [P.L. 35, 1939],
Augustine says, "My kingdom is not of this
world; you have been deceived; I am not
impeding your domination in the world, so
you fear and rage vainly."

Item Leo papa in sermone de Epiphania ait,
"Dominus mundi temporale non querit
regnum; {qui add. &NaRe} prestat eternum."
Item sic canit {ait &Na} eccelsia, "Non eripit
mortalia qui regna dat celestia."

Again, Pope Leo in his sermon on epiphany
[P.L. 54, 113] says, "The Lord of the world
does not seek a temporal kingdom; his eternal
kingdom surpasses it." Again, the church
sings as follows, "He who gives celestial
kingdoms does not snatch at mortal ones."

Ex quibus omnibus colligitur quod nec
Christus nec religio christiana alicui etiam

We gather from all these that neither Christ
nor the christian religion removes anyone's
