Capitulum 21

Chapter 21

Magister Tercius modus dicendi est quod Romana
ecclesia non habuit immediate a Christo super alias
ecclesias principatum, ymmo per plures annos post
ascensionem Domini alii ecclesie fuit subiecta; nec
eciam habuit primo principatum a conciliis vel eciam a
collegio apostolorum, sed primo et immediate habuit
principatum a beato Petro transferente sedem suam in
Romam et Romanam ecclesiam omnibus aliis ecclesiis
preferente; et ideo a Christo habuit mediate principatum.
Beatus enim Petrus, electus in papam et prelatum tocius
ecclesie a salvatore ante ascensionem, pro se et suis
successoribus ac eciam pro ecclesia ubi sedem suam
disponeret collocare primatum accepit. Et ideo quia
transtulit sedem suam de Anciochia usque Romam, nec
umquam postea ad aliam ecclesiam transtulit sedem
suam, extunc Romana ecclesia super alias ecclesias
obtinuit principatum.

Master: A third way of speaking is that the Roman
church did not have dominion over other churches
directly from Christ; rather it was subject to another
church for many years after the Lord's ascension,
and it did not in fact first obtain dominion from
councils, or even from the college of apostles. But it
acquired dominion firstly and directly from blessed
Peter's transferring his see to Rome and preferring
the Roman church to all other churches; and
therefore it acquired dominion from Christ
indirectly. For having been chosen as pope and
prelate of the whole church by the Saviour before
his ascension, blessed Peter accepted primacy on his
own behalf, on behalf of his successors and also on
behalf of the church where he was disposed to locate
his see. And because he transferred his see from
Antioch to Rome and never afterwards transferred it
to another church, the Roman church from that time
held dominion over other churches.

Hoc Marcellinus, scribens omnibus episcopis per
Anciochiam constitutis, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Rogamus,
affirmare videtur. Ait enim, "Rogamus vos fratres
dilectissimi ut non aliud doceatis neque senciatis quam
quod a beato Petro apostolo et reliquis apostolis et
patribus accepistis. Ipse enim est caput tocius ecclesie
cui Dominus ait, 'Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram
edificabo ecclesiam meam.' Eius enim sedes primitus fuit
apud vos, que postea iubente Domino Romam translata
est, cui adminiculante gracia divina hodierna die
presidemus. Si vero Anciocena, que olim prima erat,
Romane cessit sedi, nulla est que non sit eius subiecta
dicioni.

When writing to all the bishops set up through
Antioch Marcellinus seems to affirm this. For as we
find at 24, q. 1, c. Rogamus he says [col.970], "We
ask you, dearest brothers, not to teach or believe
anything that you did not receive from the blessed
apostle Peter and the rest of the apostles and fathers.
For he to whom the Lord said, 'You are Peter, and
on this rock I will build my church.' is the head of
the whole church. For his see was originally with
you and was afterwards transferred at the Lord's
command to Rome, where we are in charge today
with the support of divine grace. But if your
Antiochian [church], which formerly was first, has
given way to the Roman see, there is no [church]
which is not subject to its authority."

Ex hiis plures asserciones ad suum propositum
pertinentes nituntur isti colligere. Quarum prima est
quod Dominus ante ascensionem suam beatum Petrum
caput constituit tocius ecclesie. Et hoc eciam Anacletus
papa, ut habetur dist. 22, c. Sacrosancta, asserit
manifeste, dicens, "Inter beatos apostolos quedam fuit
discrecio, et licet omnes apostoli essent, Petro tamen a
Domino concessum est, et ipsi inter se idipsum
voluerunt, ut reliquis omnibus preesset apostolis et
Cephas, id est, caput et principatum teneret apostolatus."
Quod Christus sibi promisit dicens Iohannis 1, "Tu
vocaberis Cephas."

From these [texts] they try to infer many assertions
that are pertinent to their purpose. The first of these
is that before his ascension the Lord appointed
blessed Peter head of the whole church. Pope
Anacletus also obviously affirms this, as we find at
dist. 22, c. Sacrosancta, when he says [col.73],
"There was a certain difference [of power] among
the blessed apostles and although all were apostles,
it was nevertheless granted to Peter by the Lord and
desired among them that he should rule over all the
rest of the apostles, that is, that Cephas would
maintain headship and dominion over the
apostolate." Christ promised him this when he said
in John 1[:42], "Thou shalt be called Cephas."

Secunda assercio quam colligunt ex predictis est quod
ecclesia Anciochena super alias ecclesias habuit
principatum, quia, sicut beatus Petrus primus fuit et
princeps omnium Christianorum, ita eius sedes prima

The second assertion that they infer from the above
[texts] is that the church of Antioch had dominion
over other churches because, just as blessed Peter
was the first and most eminent of all Christians, so
