eodem Quodcumque et 4, q. 1, Scire debes, quia
certum est quod papa potest errare, ut 19 dist. c.
Anastasius. et 40 dist. c. Si papa."

that it can not err; not of the pope himself who is
called the church (the same place c. Quodcumque and
4, q. 1, c. Scire debes) because it is certain that the
pope can err, as in dist. 19, c. Anastasius and dist. 40,
c. Si papa."

Item 25. q. 1. Que ad perpetuam dicit glossa, "Papa
non potest contra generale statutum ecclesie dispensare
nec contra articulos fidei. Nam etsi omnes assenciant
ei, non valet statutum sed omnes heretici essent, ut 15.
dist. Sicut sancti."

Again, the gloss on 25, q. 1, c. Que ad perpetuam says
[s. v. nulla commutatione, col.1438]: "The pope can
not dispense against a general statute of the church
nor against the articles of faith. For even if everyone
were to agree to it, it could not be decreed, but all
would be heretics, as in dist. 15, c. Sicut sancti."

Discipulus Iste auctoritates sufficiant pro assercione
predicta; ideo adducas exempla.

Student: Those authorities are enough for the said
assertion. Would you therefore bring forward some
examples?

Magister Quod papa intrans canonice potest errare
contra catholicam veritatem multis exemplis ostenditur.
Est autem primum exemplum de apostolorum principe
beato Petro quem ideo, ut videtur, divina providencia
postquam fuit ad papatum assumptus errare permisit,
ne successores eius ipso fide et constancia et sanctite
longe inferiores se non posse errare putarent. Quod
enim beatus Petrus contra evangelii veritatem erravit
beatus Paulus ad Galatas 2. c. asserit manifeste dicens,
"Cum autem venisset Cephas Anciochiam in faciem ei
restiti quia reprehensibilis erat." Et quod
reprehensibilis erat quia erravit contra evangelicam
veritatem ostendit subdens, "Cum vidissem quod non
recte ambularet ad veritatem evangelii dixi Cephe
coram omnibus, 'Si tu cum Iudeus sis gentiliter vivis et
non Iudaice, quomodo gentes cogis Iudaizare?'" Ex hiis
verbis datur intelligi quod beatus Petrus a veritate
evangelii deviavit. Unde quod a fide exorbitaverit
habetur in decretis 2, q. 7, para. Ecce ubi Gracianus
allegat quod subditi valent reprehendere prelatos per
exemplum de Paulo qui reprehendit Beatum Petrum.
Cui allegacioni respondet dicens quod hoc licet quando
prelati a fide exorbitant quemadmodum exorbitavit
beatus Petrus. Unde dicit ibidem in hec verba, "Paulus
Petrum reprehendit qui princeps apostolorum erat.
Unde datur intelligi quod subditi possunt reprehendere
prelatos si fuerint reprehensibiles." Et isti allegacioni
respondet dicens, "Sed hoc facile refellitur si unde sit
reprehensus advertitur. Petrus cogebat gentes Iudaizare
et a veritate evangelii recedere, cum Iudeis gregem
faciens et a cibis gentilium latenter se subtrahens. Par
autem est in se a fide exorbitare et alios exemplo vel
verbo a fide deiicere. Ergo hoc exemplo non probantur
prelati accusandi a subditis nisi forte a fide
exorbitaverint vel alios exorbitare coegerint." Ex hiis
verbis patet quod beatus Petrus erravit non recte ad
veritatem Evangelii ambulando.

Master: That a pope who enters [office] canonically
can err against catholic truth is shown by many
examples. Now the first example concerns blessed
Peter, the chief of the apostles, whom divine
providence permitted to err after he was raised to the
papacy for this reason, so it seems, namely so that his
successors, far inferior to him in faith, constancy and
holiness, would not think that they are unable to fall
into error. For blessed Paul clearly asserts that blessed
Peter erred against the truth of the gospel when he
says in Galatians 2[:11]. "But when Cephas was come
to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he
was to be blamed.' And that he was to be blamed
because he erred against gospel truth he shows when
he adds below [Gal. 2:14], "But when I saw that they
walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I
said to Cephas before them all, 'If thou, being a Jew,
livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as the Jews
do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do
the Jews?'" We are given to understand by these
words that blessed Peter deviated from the truth of the
gospel. That he did turn away from the faith we find
in the decretals at 2, q. 7, para. Ecce, where Gratian
argues, from the example of Paul rebuking Peter, that
subjects can rebuke their prelates. He responds to this
argument by saying that this is permitted when
prelates turn away from the faith as Peter turned
away. Thus he says the following at that place, "Paul
rebuked Peter who was the chief of the apostles. We
are given to understand by this that subjects can
rebuke prelates if they have been blamable." And to
this argument he responds saying, "But this is easily
rebutted if we attend to why he was rebuked. Peter
was forcing the Gentiles to live as do the Jews and to
fall back from the truth of the gospel and he made a
party with the Jews, secretly refraining from Gentile
foods. But it is the same whether one turns aside from
the faith oneself or one drives others away from the
