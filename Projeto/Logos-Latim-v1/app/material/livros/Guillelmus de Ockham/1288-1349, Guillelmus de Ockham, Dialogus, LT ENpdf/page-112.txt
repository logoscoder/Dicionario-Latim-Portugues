divina ad fidem Christianam nullatenus pertinere.
Tales fuerunt Manichei qui, secundum Isidorum
prout recitatur 24. q. 3. c. Quidam autem,
Testamentum Vetus respuerunt et Novum ex parte
tantummodo receperunt et ita putabant se catholicos
et fideles Christianos et ideo fuerunt nescienter
haeretici quia assertiones contentas in Veteri
Testamento asserverunt ad fidem Christianam
minime pertinere. Quidam autem sunt nescienter
haeretici qui nullam assertionem pertinentem ad
fidem Christianam sub forma propria in scriptura
divina repertam dubitant esse veram quia totam
scripturam divinam recipiunt, sed tamen aliquas
assertiones sequentes ex illis non credunt esse veras
quia non putant quod sequantur propter hoc quod
aliter intelligunt Scripturas Divinas quam sensus
Spiritus Sancti flagitat a quo scriptae sunt. Quidam
autem credunt irrevocabiliter contrarias assertiones
esse veras; ideo haeretici sunt censendi qui tamen in
genere credunt totam fidem Christianam esse veram.

scripture in those exact words do not pertain to christian
faith. The Manichees were like this; according to
Isidore, as is reported in 24. q. 3. c. Quidam autem
[col.1001], they rejected the Old Testament and
accepted the New only in part and in this way thought
that they were catholic and faithful christians; and they
were unknowingly heretics, therefore, because they
maintained that the assertions contained in the Old
Testament do not pertain to christian faith. Certain
people are unknowingly heretics, however, who do not
doubt that any assertion pertaining to the christian faith
and found in divine scripture in those exact words is true
because they accept the whole of divine scripture, but
they do not believe, on the other hand, that some
assertions that follow from them are true, because they
do not think that they do follow from them, for the
reason that they understand the divine scriptures in a
sense other than the holy spirit, by whom they are
written, demands. Some people irrevocably believe,
moreover, that assertions contrary [to catholic faith] are
true; they should be considered heretics, therefore, even
though they believe in general that the whole christian
faith is true.

Capitulum 4

Chapter 4

Discipulus Ad quid valet ista distinctio?

Disciple What is the force of that distinction?

Magister Per istam distinctionem putant nonnulli
demonstrative probare quod obiectiones tuae non
concludunt.

Master Some people think to prove demonstratively by
that distinction that your objections are not conclusive.

Discipulus Quomodo?

Disciple How?

Magister Ex primo membro probant quod aliqui
possunt esse nescienter haeretici sic: qui credit in
genere quod tota fides Christiana est vera et tamen
credit Vetus Testamentum vel Evangelium Lucae
multa continere erronea, eo quod Vetus
Testamentum vel Evangelium Lucae putat ad fidem
Christianam nullatenus pertinere, vere est haereticus,
praesertim si est pertinax. Aliter enim posset quis
absque haeretica pravitate dicere quod omnia
evangelia ad fidem non pertinent Christianam. Sed
talis non est scienter haereticus quia non credit se in
aliquo contrariari fidei Christianae. Ergo aliquis
potest esse haereticus nescienter, quemadmodum
Manichei fuerunt haeretici nescienter quia
putaverunt se esse veraciter Christianos et omnes
alios Christianos qui Vetus Testamentum receperunt
arbitrabantur haereticos contra fidem Christianam
errantes.

Master By the first part [of the distinction] they prove
as follows that some people can unknowingly be
heretics: he who believes in general that the whole
christian faith is true and yet believes that the Old
Testament or the Gospel of Luke contains many errors,
because he thinks that the Old Testament or the Gospel
of Luke does not pertain to christian faith, is properly a
heretic, especially if he is pertinacious. (For otherwise
anyone could say without heretical wickedness that all
of the gospels do not pertain to christian faith.) But such
a person is not knowingly a heretic because he does not
believe that he is opposed to the Christian faith in
anything. Someone can be unknowingly a heretic,
therefore, just as the Manichees were unknowingly
heretics because they thought that they were truly
christians and considered that all other christians who
accepted the Old Testament were heretics erring against
christian faith.

Discipulus Dic quomodo ad obiectiones superius
tactas respondetur.

Disciple Tell me how reply is made to the objections
touched on above.
