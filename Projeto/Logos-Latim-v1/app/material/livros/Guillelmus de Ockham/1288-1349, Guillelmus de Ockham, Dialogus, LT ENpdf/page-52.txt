dictae. Et ideo dicunt quod isti errores possunt large
haereses appellari.

which is only to say that heresies properly so called
follow from them and [i.e. together with] other truths
which can not be denied. And therefore they say that
those errors can broadly be called heresies.

Discipulus Enumera generales modos pestiferorum
errorum quos secundum istam secundam sententiam
nulli licet catholico et fideli pertinaciter defensare.

Student Enumerate the general modes of pestiferous
errors which, according to that second opinion, no
catholic believer is permitted to defend pertinaciously.

Magister Tales modi generales, quorum aliqui plures
sub se modos continent speciales, sunt quinque.
Quorum primus est eorum qui solis contentis in
Scriptura Divina repugnant et iste plures modos
continet speciales, sicut ex praedictis apparet, et omnes
isti errores debent haereses appellari. Secundus est
eorum qui doctrinae apostolicae extra scripta eorum
quoquomodo repugnant, et iste etiam continet plures
modos. Tertius est eorum qui revelatis vel inspiratis
ecclesiae post apostolos quomodolibet obviarent.
Quartus est eorum qui cronicis, historiis et gestis ab
ecclesia approbatis contrariantur. Quintus est eorum
qui Scripturae Divinae vel doctrinae apostolicae extra
scripta eorum vel inspiratis seu revelatis ecclesiae et
aliis veris quae negari non possunt incompossibiles
demonstrantur, licet ex forma propositionum solis
contentis in Scriptura Divina et doctrina apostolica et
revelatis seu inspiratis ecclesiae incompossibiles
nequaquam appareant, et isti errores proprie possunt
dici sapere haeresim manifestam, licet stricte sumendo
nomen haeresis non sint haereses nuncupandae. Talis
est iste error, "Castitas monachorum castitati non
praeeminet coniugali". Nam iste error ex forma
propositionis non repugnat alicui contento in Scriptura
Divina vel doctrina apostolica, si tunc non fuerunt tales
monachi qulaes modo sunt, nec etiam repugnat, ut
videtur, alicui revelato vel inspirato ecclesiae.
Contentis tamen in Scriptura Divina et isti vero quod
nulla potest tergiversatione negari, "Monachi vovent et
servant perpetuam continentiam propter Deum",
incompossibilis esse dinoscitur, et ideo iste error, licet
non videatur stricte sumpto vocabulo haeresis
appellanda, sapit tamen haeresim manifestam quia ex
ipso et quodam vero aperto sequitur haeresis manifesta.

Master There are five of these general modes, some
of which contain several particular modes within
them. The first of these consists of those [errors]
which conflict with things contained solely in divine
scripture, and it contains several particular modes, as
is clear from what has been said above, and all those
errors should be called heresies. The second consists
of those [errors] which conflict in some way with
apostolic teaching which is outside their writings, and
that [mode] also contains several modes. The third
consists of those [errors] which would in some way be
opposed to things revealed to or inspired in the church
after the apostles. The fourth consists of those [errors]
which are contrary to chronicles, histories and deeds
approved by the church. The fifth consists of those
[errors] which are shown to be incompatible with
divine scripture, or with the teaching of the apostles
outside their writings, or with things inspired in or
revealed to the church and [i.e. together with] other
truths which can not be denied, even if by the form of
the propositions they do not appear to be incompatible
with things solely contained in divine scripture and
apostolic teaching and things revealed to and inspired
in the church, and those errors can properly be said to
smack of manifest heresy, even if they should not be
called heresies taking the word "heresy" strictly. An
example of the latter is the following error, "The
chastity of monks does not excel conjugal chastity".
For in the form of its proposition that error does not
conflict with anything contained in divine scripture or
in apostolic teaching, if there were not monks then
such as there are now, nor, as it seems, does it, also,
even conflict with anything revealed to or inspired in
the church. Yet it is known to be incompatible with
things contained in divine scripture and indeed with
the following, which can not be denied with any
shifting, "Monks vow and observe perpetual
continence for the sake of God", and therefore that
error, even if it does not seem that it should be called
a heresy taking that word strictly, does nevertheless
smack of manifest heresy because from it and a
certain clear truth manifest heresy does follow.

Discipulus Nunc adverto quam utile fuit inquirere quae
veritates debeant catholicae iudicari, quia ex solutione
quaestionis illius potest intelligenti patere qui errores

Student I now observe how useful it was to ask which
truths should be adjudged catholic, because from the
explanation of that question it can be clear to someone
