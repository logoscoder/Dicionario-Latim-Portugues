quarum prima est hec. Illa congregacio cuius iudicio in
causa fidei Romanus pontifex est subiectus contra fidem
errare non potest, quia papa non tenetur parere mandatis
alicuius congregacionis que potest contra fidem errare.
Si enim posset errare contra fidem, papa posset
iudicium illius merito recusare. Sed papa in causa fidei
iudicio generalis concilii est subiectus, cum, ut notatur
dist. 19, c. Anastasius, synodus in causa fidei maior sit
papa. Ergo synodus generalis contra fidem errare non
potest.

the first is this. That congregation to the judgement of
which the Roman pontiff is subject in a case of faith
can not err against faith because the pope is not
bound to obey the commands of any congregation
that can err against faith. For if it could err against
faith, the pope could justifiably reject its judgement.
But in a case of faith the pope is subject to the
judgement of a general council since, as is noted in
[the gloss on] dist. 19, c. Anastasius, [s. v. concilio;
col.87] a synod is greater than the pope in a case of
faith. Therefore a general synod can not err against
faith.

Secunda racio est hec. In ecclesia militante est certum
iudicium de difficilibus et obscuris que circa fidem
emergunt. Aliter enim tota ecclesia militans posset
contra fidem errare. Sed ultimum iudicium circa
difficilia et obscura circa fidem emergencia penes
concilium residet generale. Ergo concilum generale
contra fidem errare not potest.

A second argument is this. There is sure judgement in
the church militant about difficulties and obscurities
that arise concerning the faith. For otherwise the
whole church militant could err against faith. But
final judgement about difficulties and obscurities that
arise about the faith resides with a general council.
Therefore a general council can not err against faith.

Tercia racio est hec. Illa congregacio a qua in causa
fidei non est licitum appellare contra fidem errare non
potest. Omnis causa viciata est per appellacionis
remedium sublevanda (2, q. 6, c. Liceat). Causa autem
fidei tractata coram illa congregacione que contra fidem
valet errare potest viciari. Ergo licet causam fidei
tractatam coram tali congregacione, si fuerit viciata, per
appellacionis remedium sublevare, et ita licet ab ea
appellare. Sed a concilio generali in causa fidei
appellare non licet. Si enim appellare liceret, aut
appellandum esset ad aliud concilium generale, aut ad
papam, aut ad universalem ecclesiam. Non ad aliud
concilium generale, quia eadem racione ab illo concilio
generali appellare liceret, et ita finis tali cause imponi
non posset. Nec esset appellandum ad papam, quia papa
in causa fidei est inferior concilio generali, ergo a
generali concilio ad ipsum appellare non licet. Nec esset
appellandum ad universalem ecclesiam, quia frustra
esset talis appellacio cum universalis ecclesia simul in
unum convenire non possit.

A third argument is this. That congregation from
which it is not permissible to appeal in a case of faith
can not err against faith. Every case which is flawed
should be mitigated by the remedy of appeal (2, q. 6,
c. Liceat [col.472]). However a case of faith which is
handled by that congregation which can err against
faith can be flawed. It is permissible to mitigate by
remedy of appeal, therefore, a case of faith handled
by such a congregation, if it is flawed, and so it is
permissible to appeal from it. But it is not permissible
to appeal from a general council in a case of faith.
For if it were permissible to appeal, the appeal would
have to be made either to another general council, or
to the pope or to the universal church. [There can]
not [be an appeal] to another general council because
for the same reason it would be permissible to appeal
from that general council, and so no end could be
imposed in such a case. Nor should an appeal be
made to the pope because in a case of faith the pope
is inferior to a general council and so it is not
permissible to appeal to him from a general council.
Nor should an appeal be made to the universal church
because such an appeal would be fruitless since the
universal church can not come together as one at the
same time.

Quarta racio est hec. Congregacio que non potest de
heresi accusari non potest contra fidem errare.
Concilium autem generale non potest de heresi accusari,
non enim invenitur persona vel collegium cui in causa
fidei generale concilium sit subiectum. Ergo concilium
generale contra fidem errare non potest.

A fourth argument is this. A congregation that can
not be accused of heresy can not err against faith.
However, a general council can not be accused of
heresy. For we do not find a person or college to
whom or to which a general council is subject in a
case of faith. Therefore a general council can not err
against faith.

Quinta racio est hec. Illa congregacio cuius opera omni
manent stabilita vigore contra fidem errare non potest,

A fifth argument is this. That congregation whose
works persist stable and most vigorous can not err
