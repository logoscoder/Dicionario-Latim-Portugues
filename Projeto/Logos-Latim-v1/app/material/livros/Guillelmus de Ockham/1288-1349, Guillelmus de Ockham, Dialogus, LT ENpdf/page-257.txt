quia clare probatum est quod sepe vocabulum ecclesie
laicos et mulieres eciam comprehendit. Ideo indica
qualiter ad secundum medium respondetur.

seemed because it has been clearly proved that the
word 'church' often incorporates laymen and women
too. So indicate how they reply to the second reason.

Magister Ad secundum respondent negando maiorem,
dicentes quod quamvis quando clerici sunt catholici et
in sacra pagina periti et laici sunt illiterati et Divinarum
Scripturarum ignari, laici de questionibus fidei non
debeant se principaliter intromittere sed a clero
addiscere que fidei sunt, nec debeant errantes contra
fidem principaliter corrigere sed exequi ea que ad
correccionem hereticorum ordinantur provide a prelatis,
tamen si clerici omnes in hereticam inciderint
pravitatem, omnia predicta, quantum suppetit noticia
laicorum, pertinent ad eosdem.

Master: They reply to the second by denying its
major [premise], saying that although when the
clergy are catholic and learned in the sacred page and
the laity are unlearned and ignorant of the divine
scriptures the laity should not involve themselves in
questions of faith in an important way but should
learn from the clergy about matters of faith and
should not be the chief correctors of those erring
against faith but should carry out what has been
prudently ordained by prelates for the correction of
heretics, yet if all the clergy fall into heretical
wickedness, all of the above pertain to the laity, in so
far as their knowledge is sufficient.

Discipulus De ista materia interrogabo postea plura.
Ideo transi ad racionem terciam.

Student: I will ask more questions about that matter
later, so would you pass on to the third argument.

Magister Ad terciam racionem respondetur quod clerici
non sunt exempti a iudicio laicorum nisi ex voluntate
laicorum. Et ideo si omnes clerici essent effecti heretici
omnes essent iudicio laicorum subiecti, quia numquam
fuit intencio laicorum concedere clericis immunitatem
quando omnes fidem catholicam impugnarent.

Master: The reply to the third argument is that the
clergy are not exempt from the judgement of the laity
except at the will of the laity. And so if all the clergy
were to become heretics they would all be subject to
the judgement of the laity, because it was never the
intention of the laity to grant immunity to the clergy
when they were all attacking catholic faith.

Discipulus De hoc eciam conferam postea tecum. Ideo
dic quomodo respondent ad quartum motivum.

Student: I will discuss this with you later as well, so
tell me how they reply to the fourth reason.

Magister Ad quartum respondetur quod si omnes
clerici hereticarentur, potestas eligendi summum
pontificem devoluta esset ad laicos, sicut eciam
aliquando laici habuerunt potestatem summum
pontificem eligendi.

Master: The reply to the fourth is that if all
clergy were to become heretical the power
choosing the highest pontiff would devolve upon
laity, just as the laity have indeed sometimes had
power of choosing the highest pontiff.

Discipulus De hoc quoque alias specialiter indagabo.
Ideo qualiter respondent ad quintum motivum expone.

Student: This too I will particularly investigate at
another time, so set forth how they reply to the fifth
reason.

Magister Tria motiva sequencia eandem difficultatem
continere videntur propter quam dicunt nonnulli quod
quamvis maior pars, ymmo fere tota multitudo,
clericorum possit contra fidem errare et fidem
catholicam pertinaciter impugnare, tamen semper
remanebit saltem unus episcopus sacerdos catholicus
qui illa que ordinis sunt licite valeat exercere. Et ideo
concedunt illi quod omnes magistri theologie et
inferiores clerici episcopo sacerdote possunt contra
fidem errare. Deus tamen semper conservabit aliquem
sacerdotem episcopum orthodoxum ne ecclesia
potestatem habendi claves regni celorum et auctoritatem
ligandi et solvendi ac potestatem conficiendi corpus
Christi et habendi ecclesiasticam hierarchiam amittat.

Master: The three following reasons seem to contain
the same difficulty. Because of this, some of them
say that although the greater part, indeed almost the
whole multitude, of the clergy can err against faith
and pertinaciously attack catholic faith, there will
always remain at least one catholic priest-bishop [[or
this should be replaced throughout with priest or
bishop and text emended]] who can licitly carry out
those things that pertain to his order. And therefore
they grant that all the masters of theology and the
clergy inferior to a priest-bishop can err against faith.
Nevertheless God will always preserve some
orthodox priest-bishop so that the church does not
lose the power of possessing the keys of the kingdom
