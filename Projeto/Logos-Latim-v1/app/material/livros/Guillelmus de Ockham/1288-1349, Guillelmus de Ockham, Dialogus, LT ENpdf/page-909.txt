quia illa quae spectant ad bonum commune et
{om. &Pe} non competunt aliquibus ratione
ordinis aut officii divini cui mancipati existunt
{essent &Na} per sapientiores et meliores et

prosperari sunt tractanda. Et ista fuit causa
quare plures Romani pontifices in quantum
Romani una cum aliis Romanis quibusdam

that pertain to the common good and do not
belong to anyone by reason of their order or
the divine office to which they are vowed
should be managed by wiser and better men
and those through whom the common good
can best prosper. And that is the reason why
many Roman pontiffs, in so far as they were
Romans, together with other Romans gave
the right to elect the highest pontiff to some
emperors, although they were laymen.

Discipulus Quare dicit {dicitur &Re} ista
opinio quod in casu praedicto ius eligendi
reverteretur {revertetur &Mz} ad Romanos si
Romani remanerent catholici {*etc add.
&NaMzPeRe}?.

Student Why does that opinion say that in
the above case the right to elect would revert
to the Romans if the Romans were to remain
catholic, etc?

Magister Hoc dicunt {*dicit &Re} {dicitur
&Na} quia {quod &Na} si Romani cum papa
et electoribus efficerentur haeretici vel de
electione summi {Romani &Pe} pontificis ex
qua {quo &Pe} pendet bonum commune
Christianitatis essent in detrimentum
Christianae religionis negligentes vel desides
{desidentes &MzPe} ius eligendi non
reverteretur {revertetur &Mz} ad Romanos.

Master It says this because if the Romans
together with the pope and the electors
became heretics or, in connection with the
election of the highest pontiff, on which
hangs the common good of christianity, were
negligent or idle to the detriment of the
christian religion, the right to elect would not
revert to the Romans.

Discipulus Ad quos revertetur {*reverteretur
&NaPeRe} vel devolvetur {*devolveretur
&NaPeRe}?

Student To whom would it revert or upon
whom would it devolve?

Magister Dicitur quod devolvetur
{*devolveretur &NaRe} {dicitur quod
devolvetur om. &Pe} ad alios Christianos
catholicos debite de electione facienda
sollicitos.

Master It is said that it would devolve upon
other catholic christians who were duly
solicitous about making an election.

Discipulus Hoc videtur irrationabiliter
{*videtur irrationabiliter: non videtur
rationabiliter &NaMzPeRe} dictum, quia alii
catholici sunt in tanta multitudine quod non
possent in aliquem unum locum *{trs.
&NaRe} convenire ad tractandum de electione
{summi add. &Pe} futuri pontificis.

Student This does not seem to be a
reasonable statement, because there is so
great a number of other catholics that they
could not come together in any one place to
deal with the election of the future pontiff.
