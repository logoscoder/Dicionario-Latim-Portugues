sedebam quia amaritudine repletus eram."

teaching of the holy fathers and are killing,
oppressing, persecuting and attacking the defenders
of catholic truth, let him be silent at that time and not
appeal publicly to them, lest he give what is holy to
dogs and throw pearls before swine, which, turning,
will trample them by expounding the sacred
scriptures falsely, opposing them and distorting them
towards heretical falsity. And let him imitate
Jeremiah when he says, "I sat alone because I was
full of bitterness."

Ad quartam racionem respondetur quod concilium
generale de iure potest de heresi accusari. Si enim
concilium generale convocatum primo fidele ante
corporalem dissolucionem eiusdem in heresim
laberetur, posset de iure coram papa catholico, si non
esset presens, de heresi accusari, et iuxta sancciones
canonicas iudicari. Si vero papa tali concilio interesset
et una cum illa congregacione in hereticam incideret
pravitatem, potestas iudicandi omnes esset ad catholicos
devoluta, sicut si omnes prelati et clerici mundi
pravitate inficerentur heretica, potestas iudicandi omnes
devolveretur ad laicos catholicos et fideles. Generale
igitur concilium, dum manet fidele, nulli persone vel
particulari collegio in causa fidei est subiectum, licet
ipsum manens fidele universali ecclesie sit subiectum.
Sed si ante recessum conveniencium ab invicem
corporalem talis congregacio in heresim laberetur,
statim illa congregacio tota ipso iure esset alii persone
vel collegio aut congregacioni subiecta.

To the fourth argument it is replied that a general
council can by law be accused of heresy. For if a
general council that was convoked and was at first
faithful were to slip into heresy before it was
dissolved as a body, it could by law be accused of
heresy before the catholic pope, if he were not
present, and could be judged according to canonical
laws. But if the pope took part in such a council and
together with that congregation fell into heretical
wickedness, the power of judging them all would
devolve upon catholics, just as, if all the prelates and
clergy of the world were infected with heretical
wickedness, the power of judging them all would
devolve upon faithful catholic laypeople. As long as
a general council remains faithful, therefore, it is
subject in a case of faith to no person or special
college, although it is subject to the universal church
even if it remains faithful. But if such a congregation
were to fall into heresy before those who had come
together separated from each other as a body, that
whole congregation would immediately be subject by
the law itself to another person, college or
congregation.

Ad quintam racionem respondetur quod Isidorus
loquitur de conciliis generalibus rite congregatis et
celebratis absque omni errore in moribus bonis vel in
catholica veritate.

To the fifth argument it is replied that Isidore is
speaking about general councils properly convoked
and celebrated without any error in good morals or in
catholic truth.

Ad sextam racionem respondetur similiter quod
Gregorius loquitur de conciliis generalibus rite a
catholicis celebratis.

To the sixth argument it is replied similarly that
Gregory is speaking about general councils properly
celebrated by catholics.

Ad septimam respondetur eodem modo quod Gelasius
loquitur de conciliis rite a sanctis patribus celebratis,
qui, si fuissent heretici, nequaquam sancti fuissent.

To the seventh [argument] it is replied in the same
way that Gelasius is speaking about councils properly
celebrated by holy fathers, who, if they had been
heretics, would not have been holy.

Ad octavam respondetur quod si concilium generale in
heresim laberetur, remanerent alii catholici qui occulte
et publice prout expediret auderent fidem defendere
orthodoxam. Ille enim qui, reprobatis filiis carnalibus
Abrahe, potens est de lapidibus suscitare filios Abrahe
spirituales, iuxta Baptiste sentenciam, potens eciam est,
omnibus ad generale concilium convenientibus in
heresim lapsis, ymmo omnibus clericis mundi et

To the eighth [argument] it is replied that if a general
council were to fall into heresy there would remain
other catholics who secretly and publicly, as was
appropriate, would dare to defend orthodox faith. For
he who is able to raise up spiritual children of
Abraham from stones, his fleshly children having
been condemned, as the Baptist teaches, is also able
to raise up catholic children of God from stones, that
