Discipulus Si sint alii modi ponendi negativam
praedictarum assertionum ad improbandum
istos {istas &Mz} {*praedictarum ... istos:
praedictae assertionis &NaRe} puto quod
valeant reduci ad istos. Ideo sufficit {*sufficiat
&MzNaRe} adducere motiva quae allegari
possunt pro istis vel {*pro istis vel om.
&NaRe} ad improbandum istos. Dic ergo
quomodo improbatur prima {*primus
&NaRe}.

Student If there are other ways of putting the
negation of the earlier assertion, I think that
they can be reduced to these [just cited]. Let
it be enough, therefore, to adduce arguments
that can be brought forward to refute them.
So tell me how the first [way] is refuted.

Magister Quomodo possit ostendi et allegari
{*trs.321 &NaRe} quod non sit expediens
diversa regna vel provincias habere diversos
summos {*supremos &NaRe} iudices qui nulli
superiori sint subiecti ex his quae allegata sunt
primo huius cap. 1 potest advertere {*adducere
&NaRe} studiosus.

Master Anyone who is zealous can adduce
from what was brought forward in chapter one
of the first [book] of this [tractate] how it can
be argued and shown that it is not expedient
for different kingdoms and provinces to have
different supreme judges who are not subject
to any superior.

Discipulus Converte te ad secundum et indica
quomodo potest improbari ille modus dicendi
qui tenet quod non est contra dispositionem
bonam {*trs. &MzNaRe} communitatis
fidelium ut respectu eorundem sint diversi
iudices summi {*supremi &NaRe} vel {*om.
&NaRe} non habentes idem officium, sicut
aliqui ponunt {*trs. &MzNaRe} de papa et
imperatore quia {*quod &NaRe} uterque
seorsum sine requisitione et consensu alterius
potest eundem pro eodem delicto percellere
{procellere &Mz}.

Student Turn to the second and indicate how
one can refute that way of speaking which
holds that it is not against good management
of a community of believers for there to be,
with respect to the same people, different
supreme judges not holding the same office,
as some posit about the pope and the emperor
that each separately can, without the request
or agreement of the other, punish the same
person for the same crime.

Magister Hoc multis rationibus improbatur
{probatur &NaRe}. Primo sic: delinquentes
non possunt debito modo puniri nisi citentur
vel capti ducantur ad iudicem; sed si sunt
plures iudices quorum quilibet seorsum absque
alio potest iudicare reum poterit contingere ut
{*quod &NaRe} nec citatus valeat comparere
nec captus aut capiendus valeat iudici
praesentari. Nam poterit {poterat &Mz}
contingere quod uterque iudex suam
iurisdictionem cupiens exercere citet reum pro
eodem tempore vel quod uterque ad ipsum
capiendum mittat familiam. Si autem uterque
{*om. &MzNaRe} citetur {*citatur
&MzNaRe} ab utroque, aut comparebit coram

Master This is refuted by many arguments of
which the first is as follows. [1] Those
committing a crime can not be duly punished
unless they are summoned or led captive to a
judge; but if there are many judges, each of
whom can separately judge a guilty man
without the other, it could happen that he who
is summoned can not appear and he who is or
should be captured can not be presented
before a judge. For it could happen that each
judge, wishing to exercise his own
jurisdiction, summons the guilty man [to
appear] at the same time, or that each sends
his retainers to capture him. If he is
summoned by both, however, either he will
