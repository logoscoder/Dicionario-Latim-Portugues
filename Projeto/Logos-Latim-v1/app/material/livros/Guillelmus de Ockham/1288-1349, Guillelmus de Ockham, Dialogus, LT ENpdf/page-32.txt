bibliae est credendum.

what writers in addition to the writers of the bible
should be believed.

According to the second opinion, what authorities should be believed besides the Bible?
Magister Ad interrogationem tuam a diversis
diversimode respondetur. Quidam enim dicunt quod
universis conciliis generalibus et omnibus summis
pontificibus in his quae diffiniuntur esse credenda et
omnibus sanctis Scripturae Sacrae tractatoribus credere
est necesse, licet ea quae dicunt per Sacram Scripturam
nequeant demonstrare. Pro hac assertione videtur
facere quod legitur dist. 15 c. 1, ubi de conciliis
generalibus recipiendis habetur aperte, et etiam c. Sicut
et c. Sancta Romana. De assertionibus vero summorum
pontificum recipiendis habetur dist. 19, c. Si
Romanorum et in pluribus aliis. De traditionibus autem
sanctorum habetur dist. 15, c. Sancta.

Master Different people reply to your question in
different ways. For some people say that it is
necessary to believe all general councils and all
highest pontiffs, in respect of those things which are
defined as needing to be believed, and all the saints
who wrote on sacred scripture, even if they can not
demonstrate what they say by sacred scripture. What
we read in dist. 15, c. 1 [col.34], where we clearly find
that general councils should be accepted, and c. Sicut
[col.35] and c. Sancta Romana [col.35], seems to
support this assertion. Moreover, we find [material]
about accepting the assertions of highest pontiffs in
dist. 19, c. Si Romanorum [col.58] and in many other
chapters. We find [material] about the teachings of
saints in dist. 15, c. Sancta [Romana] [col.35].

Alii vero praedictae assertioni non usquequaque
consentiunt, asserentes quod licet assertionibus
generalium conciliorum sit universaliter adhaerendum,
licet etiam multis decretis seu decretalibus ac
diffinitionibus Romanorum pontificum ac pluribus
opusculis sanctorum doctorum pro eo quod omnia quae
inveniuntur in eis constat esse consona catholicae
veritati oporteat catholicos consentire, non tamen eo
ipso quod Romani pontifices vel sancti tradunt aliquid
esse credendum est hoc tanquam consonum veritati
necesse accipere.

But others do not entirely agree with the above point
of view, affirming that although there should be
universal adherence to the assertions of general
councils and although it is necessary for catholics to
agree with many decrees or decretals and definitions
of Roman pontiffs and many works of learned saints
on the grounds that it is certain that everything found
in them is [in fact] in accord with catholic truth, yet it
is not the case that just because the Roman pontiffs
and the saints teach that something is to be believed it
must [therefore] be accepted as being in harmony with
the truth.

Discipulus De generalibus conciliis et summis
pontificibus intendo postea aliqua ad materiam istam
spectantia indagare et ideo hic nihil loquaris de ipsis.
Sed de sanctis obsecro resera quid praedicti sentiunt
assertores.

Student I intend to investigate later some matters
pertaining to general councils and highest pontiffs and
so would you say nothing about them here. But I do
ask you to disclose what those who assert the above
think about the saints.

According to the second opinion, it is not always necessary to believe what has been said by the saints
Magister De sanctis duas conclusiones affirmant.
Quarum prima est quod non eo ipso quod aliquis
sanctus aliquid opinatur esse credendum est a cunctis
fidelibus tanquam veritati consonum approbandum.
Secunda est quod non omnibus sententiis quae
inveniuntur in sanctorum opusculis iam per ecclesiam
divulgatis est firmiter adhaerendum.

Master They affirm two conclusions about the saints.
The first is that it is not the case that just because
some saint opines that something should be believed,
it should be approved by all believers as in harmony
with the truth. The second is that not all opinions
which are found in the works of the saints, even those
published throughout the church, should be adhered to
firmly.

Prima conclusio probatur auctoritatibus sancti
Augustini quae ponuntur dist. 9, c. Noli et c. Negare et
c. Ego et c. Quis nesciat et c. Noli et c. Neque. In
quibus manifeste asserit Augustinus quod nonnulla in
opusculis sanctorum et suis inserta licet fidelibus iusto

The first conclusion is proved from texts of St.
Augustine included in dist. 9, c. Noli [col.17], et c.
Negare [col.17] and c. Ego [col. 17] and c. Quis
nesciat [col. 17] and c. Noli [col. 18] and c. Neque
[col. 18]. Augustine clearly affirms in these that it is
