distinction within human law, because
some human laws are the laws of emperors
and other people and particular
communities subject to the emperor and
these can be called civil [laws]. Some are to
a certain extent [laws] of the whole
community of mortals and these seem to
pertain to the law of nations. These are to a
certain extent natural and to a certain extent
human and positive, as can be gathered
from what was said in chapters 10 and 11
in the first [book] of this [part]. [[reference
seems wrong]] The emperor is not bound
by necessity to the first laws, that is the
purely civil ones, whether they are his or
[the laws] of other people or particular
communities, although it is proper for him
to live in accord with his own laws.
Because of the fact that all nations,
especially those that are rational and live in
accord with reason, accept this law, the
emperor is bound to these second laws
which pertain to the law of nations, and he
is not permitted to transgress them
regularly, except in a particular case in
which he sees that they detract from the
common benefit. Hence he would not be
permitted generally to prohibit occupations
of places, wars, captures, slavery, reprisals,
the non-violation of the religion of
ambassadors and other things that are
known to pertain to the law of nations.
However, for the emperor not to have
fullness of power to be able to do anything
in temporal matters which is not against
divine law or absolute natural law, which
was discussed above in chapters 10 and 11
of the first [book] of this [part] [[seems
wrong]], pertains to the law of nations, just
as it is also known to pertain to the law of
nations for some men to be free and not
purely slaves, in that one follows from the
other. And therefore the emperor is bound
by this law, which nevertheless is a human
law because, if all mortals agreed and there
was no one at all in opposition, its opposite
could be preserved as law.
