Divinae repugnat, sicut et tenent contrarium opinantes.
Unde et eam per Scripturam Divinam improbare
nituntur, sicut in scriptis eorum patet aperte, et ita in rei

based on the divine scripture. One or other of these is
in truth of fact opposed to divine scripture, as those
holding these opposing [opinions] do indeed maintain.
So it is that each tries to disprove the other through
divine scripture, as is quite clear in their writings.Thus
in truth of fact one of them has been implicitly
condemned, since the opposing truth has been
implicitly approved because of the fact that the
teaching of the church from which it has been inferred
is known to have been approved.

Capitulum 20

Chapter 20

Discipulus Sive isti devient a proprio modo loquendi
sive non video quod inter haereses quas dicunt esse
damnatas explicite et quas dicunt esse damnata
simplicite implicite est aperta distinctio. Sed ad quam
utilitatem istam distinctionem assignant ignoro et
tamen desidero scire.

Student Either they are deviating from their own way
of speaking or I do not see that there is a clear
distinction between the heresies that they say have
been condemned explicitly and those that they say
have been condemned only implicitly. But I do not
even know, and yet want to know, what utility they
assign to that distinction.

Who has the authority to condemn heresies?
Magister Putant istam distinctionem esse summe
necessariam episcopis et inquisitoribus haereticae
pravitatis, ut sciant contra quos accusatos de haeresi
debeant procedere et contra quos potestatem
procedendi non habent. Nam omnes tenentes
pertinaciter haeresim aliquo praedictorum modorum
damnatam explicite possunt legitime iudicare.
Tenentes vero haereses damnatas tantummodo
implicite iudicare non possunt nec de talibus
haeresibus. Licet eas valeant ventilare et investigando
discutere, de eis tamen nequeunt diffinitivam
sententiam proferre. Sed huiusmodi haeresim asserens
vel defendens summi pontificis vel generalis concilii
est reservandus examini.

Master They think that that distinction is of the
highest importance to bishops and inquisitors into
heretical wickedness so that they may know against
which of those accused of heresy they ought to
proceed and against which they do not have the power
to proceed. For they can legitimately judge all those
pertinaciously maintaining a heresy explicitly
condemned in any of the above ways. But they can
not judge those maintaining heresies condemned only
implicitly, nor judge of such heresies. Although they
can discuss them and inquire into them by
investigation, nevertheless they can not pronounce a
definitive sentence about them. On the contrary,
anyone affirming or defending a heresy of this kind
should be kept for examination by the highest pontiff
or a general council.

Discipulus Si isti suam sententiam auctoritate vel
ratione valeant confirmare non tardes ostendere.

Student If they can confirm their opinion with an
authority or an argument, do not be slow to show me.

Magister Possunt se fundare in una ratione quae talis
est. Ad illum solum spectat asserentem damnatam
haeresim implicite, de qua nondum innotuit ecclesiae
an debeat haeresis reputari, tanquam haereticum
condemnare ad quem spectat huiusmodi haereses
solenniter condemnare; quod videtur maxime veritatem
habere quando inter catholicos literatos in sacra pagina
eruditos de tali assertione an debeat censeri haeretica
opiniones habentur contrariae. Sed assertionem quae
est in rei veritate haeretica, de qua tamen an sit
haeretica inter doctos opiniones reperiuntur contrariae,
solenniter et explicite condemnare pertinet ad solum
summum pontificem et concilium generale et

Master They can found themselves on one argument
which is the following. The condemnation as a heretic
of someone asserting an implicitly condemned heresy
about which it has not yet become clear to the church
whether it should be regarded as a heresy pertains
only to him to whom it pertains solemnly to condemn
heresies of this kind; this seems especially to be true
when opposing opinions are held among learned
catholics well informed about the sacred page about
whether an assertion of this kind should be considered
heretical. But the solemn and explicit condemnation
of an assertion which in truth of fact is heretical yet
about which opposing opinions are found among the
