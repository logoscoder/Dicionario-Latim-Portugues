Discipulus Licet moriatur patriarcha Anciochenus, non
tamen moritur ecclesia Anciochena, quia adhuc remanet
aliquis qui potest creari in patriarcham Anciochenum.

Student: Even if the patriarch of Antioch dies, the
church of Antioch does not die because there is still
someone who can be created patriarch of Antioch.

Magister Per talem modum posset dici quod numquam
potest deficere fides ecclesie Massiliensis, quia semper
erit aliquis qui poterit creari in episcopum
Massiliensem, eciam si omnes de Massilia
converterentur ad Machometum, vel semper erunt aliqui
qui poterunt eligere illum qui poterit creari in
episcopum Massiliensem. Dicunt ergo isti quod cum ex
solis Scripturis Divinis teneatur quod ecclesia numquam
errabit contra fidem, quia semper erunt aliqui in ecclesia
Christi fideles, et verba Scripture Divine ex quibus
colligitur quod ecclesia numquam errabit contra fidem
nullam de ecclesia Romana faciant penitus mencionem
non plus quam de ecclesia Anciochena, sicut
temerarium fuit asserere quod ecclesia Anciochena non
errabit contra fidem, ita nunc temerarium est asserere
quod Romana ecclesia numquam errabit contra fidem.

[See Significant Variants, para. 35.] Master: It could
be said in this way that the faith of the church of
Marseilles can never fail because there will always be
someone who can be created bishop of Marseilles,
even if everyone from Marseilles was converted to
Islam, or there will always be some people who could
choose him who could be created bishop of
Marseilles. They say, therefore, that since it is
maintained only on the basis of the divine scriptures
that the church will never err against faith, because
there will always be some believers in the church of
Christ, and since the words of divine scripture by
which it is inferred that the church will never err
against faith do not make any mention at all of the
Roman church, no more than of the church of
Antioch, it is rash to affirm now that the Roman
church will never err against faith just as it was rash
to affirm that the church of Antioch will not err
against faith.

Discipulus Licet Scriptura Divina, cum insinuat quod
ecclesia numquam errabit contra fidem, de Romana
ecclesia vocalem non faciat mencionem, tamen de
Romana ecclesia verba illa scripture debent intelligi,
quia Scriptura Divina intelligenda est sicut a sanctis
patribus est exposita. Sancti autem intelligunt verba
scripture illius de Romana ecclesia. Unde et asserunt
quod Romana ecclesia numquam contra fidem errabit.

Student: Although divine scripture makes no explicit
mention of the Roman church when it declares that
the church will never err against faith, those words of
scripture should nevertheless be understood of the
Roman church because divine scripture should be
understood in the way it has been expounded by the
holy fathers. However the saints understand those
words of scripture to refer to the Roman church. So it
is that they affirm that the Roman church will never
err against faith.

Magister Ad hoc tripliciter respondetur quod sancti non
exponunt verba illa scripture de Romana ecclesia prout
Romana ecclesia est pars distincta contra alias ecclesias,
sed exponunt verba scripture de materia illa loquencia
de ecclesia catholica et apostolica que comprehendit
omnem ecclesiam tenentem fidem apostolorum, sive
Rome, sive in Yspania, sive in Gallia, sive in Germania.
Nec dicunt quod Romana ecclesia que est Rome vel de
facto se gerit pro Romana ecclesia non possit errare vel
numquam errabit contra fidem, licet aliquando affirment
quod non inveniatur errasse secundum se totam,
quamvis aliquando pro maiori parte erraverit. Tempore
enim Liberii pape, postquam consensit perfidie Arriane,
maior pars Christianorum Rome consensit heretice
pravitati. Tunc enim pauci Romani imperatori et Liberio
resistebant, et illi pauci clerici qui erant contrarii
Liberio occidebantur. Licet autem sancti asseruerint
quod ecclesia Romana secundum se totam in tempore
preterito non erraverit contra fidem, numquam tamen
affirmant quod non errabit in futuro.

Master: It is replied to this in a three-fold way that
the saints do not expound those words of scripture
about the Roman church in so far as the Roman
church is a part distinguished from other churches,
but the words of scripture that talk about that matter
they expound about the catholic and apostolic church
which comprises every church holding the faith of
the apostles, whether in Rome, Spain, France or
Germany. Nor do they say that the Roman church
which is at Rome or which acts de facto as the
Roman church can not err or will never err against
faith, although sometimes they affirm that it will not
be found to have erred as a totality even if sometimes
a greater part of it has erred. For in the time of Pope
Liberius the greater part of the Christians of Rome
agreed with heretical wickedness after he agreed to
the Arian perfidy. For then few Romans resisted the
emperor and Liberius, and those few clerics who
were opposed to Liberius were killed. However,
although the saints have asserted that the Roman
church as a totality has not erred against faith in time
past, yet they never affirm that it will not err in the
