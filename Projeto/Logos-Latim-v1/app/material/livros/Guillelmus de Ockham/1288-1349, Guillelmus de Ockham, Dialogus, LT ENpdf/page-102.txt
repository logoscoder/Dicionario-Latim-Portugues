Sacra Scriptura nec ex dictis autenticis neque ex
ratione evidenti patenter colligi potest, nos non
debemus distinguere. Ubi autem ex aliquibus vel
aliquo praedictorum distinctio manifeste accipitur et
nos debemus distinguere. Sic est in proposito quia ex
aliis sacris canonibus et ratione aperta colligitur
luculenter quod inter labentem in haeresim damnatam
pertinaciter et non pertinaciter est distinctio manifesta.

distinction can clearly be gathered from other canons
or from sacred scripture or from authentic sayings or
from evident reason, we should not distinguish. When
a distinction can clearly be apprehended, however,
from some or one of the above, we should indeed
distinguish. It is so in the matter under discussion
because we gather very well from other sacred canons
and from clear reason that there is an obvious
distinction between falling into a condemned heresy
pertinaciously and not pertinaciously.

Dicunt etiam quod Gelasius in c. Maiores loquitur de
scienter communicatore erroris damnati et etiam de
pertinaci sive sciat errorem suum esse damnatum sive
ignoret.

They say too that in c. Maiores [24, q. 1, c.2; col.966]
Gelasius is speaking about someone knowingly
participating in a condemned error and also about
someone pertinacious whether he knows that his error
has been condemned or not.

Ad auctoritatem Felicis papae respondent quod
loquitur de Achatio, qui scienter damnato
communicavit facinori. Et ideo fuit pertinax iudicandus
quia non erat paratus corrigi per doctrinam ecclesiae.

To the text of Pope Felix they reply that he is
speaking about Achatius who knowingly participated
in a condemned misdeed; and therefore he should
have been adjudged pertinacious because he was not
ready to be corrected by the teaching of the church.

Ad auctoritatem beati Hieronimi quae ponitur 24, q. 3,
c. Haeresis respondent quod sicut recessus a malis est
duplex, scilicet corporalis et spiritualis, prout asserit
Augustinus secundum quod legitur 23, q. 4, c. 1, sic
recessus ab ecclesia est duplex, scilicet corporalis et
spiritualis. Corporalis autem recessus ex multis causis
fieri potest. Potest enim quis recedere corporaliter ab
ecclesia et ad haereticos corporaliter accedere quia
doctrinae suae vel opinioni ecclesia non consentit aut
reprobat. Et de isto recessu corporali ad praesens
loquimur, non de alio recessu corporali qui ex bona
causa posset accidere. Alius est recessus ab ecclesia
spiritualis et iste est duplex, scilicet manifestus et
occultus, secundum quod haereticus est duplex, scilicet
manifestus et occultus. Similiter aliter intelligere
Scripturam quam sensus Spiritus Sancti flagitat
contingit dupliciter, scilicet cum pertinaci adhaesione
et absque pertinaci adhaesione. Quicunque igitur cum
pertinaci adhaesione aliter Scripturam intelligit quam
sensus Spiritus Sancti flagitat, licet ab ecclesia non
recesserit neque corporaliter, propter hoc quod suo
sensui ecclesia non consentit vel reprobat eundem,
neque spiritualiter manifeste, quia se esse pertinacem
nequaquam ostendit aperte, tamen haereticus appellari
potest, imo vere est haereticus quia ab ecclesia recessit
spiritualiter licet occulte.

To the text of blessed Jerome which is located in 24,
q. 3, c. Haeresis [col.997] they reply that just as there
is a twofold withdrawal from evil, that is bodily and
spiritual, as Augustine asserts according to what we
read in 23, q. 4, c. 1 [col.899], so withdrawal from the
church is twofold, that is bodily and spiritual. Bodily
withdrawal can happen for many reasons however.
For someone can bodily withdraw from the church
and bodily go to heretics because the church does not
agree with or rejects his teaching or opinion. And it is
about this bodily withdrawal that we are now
speaking, not about another bodily withdrawal that
could happen for a good reason. Another withdrawal
from the church is spiritual, and that is twofold,
namely open or hidden, and in accordance with this
there are two kinds of heretic, namely an open or a
hidden one. Similarly it is possible to understand
scripture otherwise than in the sense the holy spirit
demands in two ways, namely with pertinacious
adherence or without it. Therefore even if anyone who
with pertinacious adherence understands scripture
otherwise than in the sense the holy spirit demands
does not withdraw from the church, either bodily
(because of the fact that the church does not agree
with or rejects his perception), or spiritually in a
manifest way, (since he does not clearly show himself
to be pertinacious), nevertheless he can be called a
heretic, indeed he truly is a heretic because he has
withdrawn spiritually from the church even if in a
hidden way.

Ad auctoritatem Stephani papae respondent dicentes
quod Stephanus papa vocat illum dubium in fide qui
dubitat fidem christianam esse veram vel sanam, non

They reply to the text of Pope Stephen by saying that
he calls him a doubter in faith who doubts that the
christian faith is true or sound, not him who doubts
