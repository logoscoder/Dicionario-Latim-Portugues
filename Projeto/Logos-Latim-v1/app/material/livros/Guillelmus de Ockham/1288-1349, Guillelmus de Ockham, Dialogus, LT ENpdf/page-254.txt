seculi cum militante ecclesia permanebit non solum per
fidem et dileccionem sed eciam per suam presenciam
sacramentalem. Ergo semper erunt in ecclesia aliqui
sacerdotes qui potestatem habebunt conficiendi corpus
Christi. Sed si tota multitudo clericorum hereticaretur,
nullus esset in ecclesia qui potestatem haberet
conficiendi corpus Christi, quod numquam accidet.
Ergo numquam tota multitudo clericorum exorbitabit a
fide.

Christ will remain with the church militant, not only
through faith and love but also by his sacramental
presence. Therefore there will always be some priests
in the church who will have the power of
consecrating the body of Christ. But if the whole
multitude of the clergy were to become heretical
there would be no one in the church who would have
the power to consecrate the body of Christ. This will
never happen, so the whole multitude of the clergy
will never deviate from faith.

Septimum eorum motivum est tale. Ecclesiastica
yerarchia usque ad finem seculi permanebit. Sed in solis
prelatis et sacerdotibus et ceteris clericis consistit
ecclesiastica yerarchia. Ergo semper usque ad finem
seculi aliqui prelati sacerdotes et alii clerici fideles et
catholici permanebunt.

Their seventh reason is as follows. The ecclesiastical
hierarchy will continue until the end of the age. But
the ecclesiastical hierarchy consists only of prelates,
priests and the rest of the clergy. Therefore some
prelates, priests and other clergy will continue
believing and catholic until the end of the age.

Tria ultima media confirmantur una racione tali. Si tota
multitudo clericorum posset hereticari, eadem racione
tota multitudo clericorum posset per mortem extingui,
ymmo occidi. Sed numquam ante finem mundi tota
multitudo clericorum erit extincta, quia si tota multitudo
clericorum esset extincta non solum ecclesia esset
privata clavibus regni celorum et potestate ligandi et
solvendi ac eciam sacramento corporis Christi et
ecclesiastica yerarchia, sed eciam privata esset potestate
habendi predicta. Quamvis enim si tota multitudo
clericorum hereticaretur ecclesia careret predictis de
facto, tamen, si remanerent aliqui clerici heretici,
possent aliqui catholici ordinari ab eis; quod, ut videtur
aliquibus, esset licitum in illo casu, sicut in articulo
necessitatis licet ab hereticis baptismi recipere
sacramentum. Quibus ordinatis possent predicta omnia
reparari. Sed si nulli clerici, neque catholici neque
heretici, remanerent, numquam posset aliquis in
ecclesia habere claves neque potestatem ligandi et
solvendi nec conficere corpus Christi neque umquam
posset esse ecclesiastica yerarchia. Et ita inconveniens
est dicere quod tota multitudo clericorum per mortem
extingui potest. Quare inconveniens est asserere totam
multitudinem clericorum posse in hereticam incidere
pravitatem.

The last three reasons are confirmed by the one
argument that follows. If the whole multitude of the
clergy could become heretical, by the same reasoning
the whole multitude of the clergy could be eliminated
by death, indeed could be killed. But the whole
multitude of the clergy will never be eliminated
before the end of the world, because if the whole
multitude of the clergy were eliminated not only
would the church be deprived of the keys to the
kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing
and also the sacrament of the body of Christ and the
ecclesiastical hierarchy but it would also be deprived
of the power of having them. For although the church
would in fact lack those things, if the whole
multitude of the clergy were to become heretical,
nevertheless some catholics could be ordained by
heretical clergy, if any were remaining. It seems to
some people that this would be permissible in that
case, just as at a time of necessity it is permissible to
receive the sacrament of baptism from heretics.
When these were ordained all the above matters
could be rectified. But if no clergy, either catholic or
heretical, were to remain, there could never be
anyone in the church to have the keys and the power
of binding and loosing or the ability to consecrate the
body of Christ and there could never be an
ecclesiastical hierarchy. And so it is not fitting to say
that the whole multitude of the clergy can be
eliminated by death. Therefore it is not fitting to
affirm that the whole multitude of the clergy can fall
into heretical wickedness.

Octavum motivum eorum est tale. Tota multitudo
eorum nequit contra fidem errare a qua quicumque
separatur cum ecclesia Dei pacem habere non potest.
Sed quicumque separatur a tota multitudine clericorum
pacem cum ecclesia Dei habere non potest, teste
Cypriano, qui, ut recitatur. 7, q. 1, c. Novacianus, ait,
"Qui ergo nec coniunccionem pacis nec unitatem

Their eighth reason is the following. The whole
multitude of those from whom whoever is separated
can not have peace with the church of God can not
err against faith. But whoever is separated from the
whole multitude of the clergy can not have peace
with the church of God. Cyprian attests to this when
he says, as we find in 7, q. 1, c. Novacianus
