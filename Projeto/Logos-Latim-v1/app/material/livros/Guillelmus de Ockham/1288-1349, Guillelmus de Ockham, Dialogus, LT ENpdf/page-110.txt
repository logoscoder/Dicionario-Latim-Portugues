Discipulus Potestne aliquis dubitare pertinaciter
contra fidem?

Disciple Can someone pertinaciously doubt the faith?

Magister Dicitur quod tot modis quis potest
pertinaciter dubitare contra fidem quot modis potest
errare pertinaciter contra fidem.

Master It is said that someone can doubt the faith
pertinaciously in as many ways as he can err
pertinaciously against the faith.

Discipulus Nunquid potest alio modo distingui de
pertinaci propter pertinaciam interiorem?

Disciple Can a distinction concerning the pertinacious
person be made in another way, on account of interior
pertinacity?

Magister Aliter distinguitur de tali pertinaci saltem
quantum ad verba, quia sicut secundum beatum
Augustinum quidam est haereticus scienter et
quidam est haereticus nescienter, ita quidam est
pertinax scienter, ille scilicet qui putat fidem
Christianam pro aliqua sui parte esse falsam, et
quidam est pertinax nescienter, qui scilicet credit in
genere totam fidem Christianam esse veram, in
speciali tamen alicui errori pertinaciter contra fidem
adhaeret.

Master A distinction is made concerning the
pertinacious person in another way, at least as far as it
concerns words, because just as, according to blessed
Augustine, one person is knowingly a heretic and
another person is unknowingly a heretic, so one person
is knowingly pertinacious - namely he who thinks that
the christian faith is in some part false - and another is
unknowingly pertinacious - namely he who believes in
general that the whole christian faith is true but clings
pertinaciously to some particular error against the faith.

Is it possible to be a heretic knowingly?
Discipulus Quomodo quis potest scienter pertinax
esse? Videtur enim quod hoc contradictionem
includit. Si enim est scienter pertinax scit se esse
pertinacem; sed hoc includit contradictionem, quia
qui errat putat esse verum circa quod errat, eo quod
errare est approbare falsum pro vero. Nullus ergo scit
se errare. Et ita nullus est scienter pertinax quia
nullus scit se esse pertinacem in errore.

[See Significant Variants, para. 15.] Disciple How can
someone be knowingly pertinacious? This seems to
contain a contradiction, for if he is knowingly
pertinacious, he knows that he is pertinacious; but this
contains a contradiction, because he who errs thinks that
to be true about which he is in error, in that to err is to
regard the false as true. No one therefore knows that he
errs; and thus no one is knowingly pertinacious because
no one knows that he is pertinacious in error.

Magister Ista sententia "pertinacis scienter" non
debet referri ad pertinaciam errantis, ut aliquis sciat
se pertinaciter errare, sed debet referri ad
contrarietatem suae pertinaciae vel erroris ad fidem
Christianam, ut dicatur scienter pertinax quia scit
assertionem circa quam errat esse contrariam fidei
Christianae, quemadmodum dicitur quis scienter
haereticus non quia sciat se esse haereticum sed quia
scit assertionem suam esse contrariam fidei
Christianae. Sicut igitur ille vocatur scienter
haereticus qui scit assertionem suam quae in rei
veritate est haeresis esse contrariam fidei
Christianae, et ille dicitur ignoranter sive nescienter
hereticus qui assertionem suam nescit esse
contrariam fidei Christianae sed putat esse consonam
fidei Christianae, sic ille dicitur scienter pertinax in
errore haereticali qui scit assertionem quam putat
veram esse contrariam fidei Christianae. Ille autem
dicitur ignoranter sive nescienter pertinax in errore
haereticali qui nescit assertionem suam esse
contrariam fidei Christianae.

Master That phrase "knowingly pertinacious" should
not be related to the pertinacity of the person erring - in
the sense that someone knows himself to err
pertinaciously - but should be related to the opposition
between his pertinacity or error and the christian faith in the sense that he is said to be knowingly pertinacious
because he knows that the assertion about which he is in
error is opposed to christian faith. In the same way
someone is said to be knowingly a heretic not because
he may know he is a heretic but because he knows that
his assertion is opposed to the christian faith. Just as he
is called knowingly a heretic, therefore, who knows that
his assertion, which in truth of fact is a heresy, is
contrary to christian faith and he is called ignorantly or
unknowingly a heretic who does not know that his
assertion is opposed to christian faith but thinks that it is
consistent with christian faith, so he is called knowingly
pertinacious in heretical error who knows that an
assertion which he thinks is true is opposed to christian
faith. But he is called ignorantly or unknowingly
pertinacious in heretical error who does not know that
his assertion is opposed to christian faith.
