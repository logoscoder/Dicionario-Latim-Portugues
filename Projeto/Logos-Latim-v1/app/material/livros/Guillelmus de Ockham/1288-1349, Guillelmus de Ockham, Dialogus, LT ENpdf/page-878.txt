Ecclesiastica, ut legitur {habetur &Pe} dist. 63,
c. Adrianus, ubi {*om. &NaRe} sic habetur,
"Adrianus Papa Romam venire Carolum regem
{francorum add. &Pe} ad defendendas
{defendendum &Pe} res ecclesiae postulavit."
et infra, "Deinde Romam reversus," scilicet
Carolus rex, "ibi {ibidem &NaRe} constituit
{*trs. &MzNaPeReZn} synodum cum Adriano
Papa in Patriarchia {*patriarchio
&NaMzPeReZn} Lateranensi {Laterani

synodus celebrata est a centum quinquaginta
tribus episcopis et {*om. &NaMzPeReZn}
abbatibus et religiosis {*trs.321
&MzNaReZn}. Adrianus autem Papa cum
universa synodo tradidit {*tradiderunt
&NaPeReZn} Carolo ius et potestatem eligendi
pontificem et ordinandi apostolicam sedem.
Dignitatem quoque patriciatus ei {eius &Mz}

synod there with Pope Hadrian in the
church of the Holy Saviour in the Lateran
palace, a synod celebrated by 153 bishops,
religious and abbots. Then Pope Hadrian,
together with the whole synod committed to
Charles the right and power to elect the
pontiff and to ordain to the apostolic see.
They also granted to him the dignity of the
patriciate. He also pronounced that bishops
and archbishops in every province were to
accept investiture from him, and that a
bishop was to be consecrated by no one
unless he was confirmed and invested by
the king; and he bound with the chain of
anathema anyone who was against this
decree and ordered that his goods be
confiscated if he did not come to his
senses."

Item Leo Papa, ut in eadem distinctione
{dicitur &Mz} {*habetur add. &NaRe} c.
{cum &Mz} In synodo, sic ait, "In synodo
congregata Romae in ecclesia sancti Salvatoris.
et {*om. &NaMzPeRe} Ad exemplum beati
Adriani apostolicae sedis {sede &Mz} {pro

&Na} episcoporum concessit: ego quoque Leo,
servus servorum Dei, episcopus, cum cuncto
clero {trs. &Pe} ac Romano populo
constituimus, confirmamus {confirmavimus

Again, as we find in the same distinction, c.
In synodo [c.23, col.241], Pope Leo says
the following, "In the synod gathered
together at Rome in the church of the Holy
Saviour. At the instance of the blessed
Hadrian bishop of the apostolic see who
granted to the lord Charles, most victorious
king of the Franks and the Lombards, the
dignity of the patriciate, the [right to] ordain
to the apostolic see and the [right] to invest
bishops; I too, Leo, bishop and servant of
the servants of God, together with the
whole clergy and Roman people, determine,
confirm and strengthen and, by our
apostolic authority, concede and grant to
the lord Otto I, king of the Teutons, and to
