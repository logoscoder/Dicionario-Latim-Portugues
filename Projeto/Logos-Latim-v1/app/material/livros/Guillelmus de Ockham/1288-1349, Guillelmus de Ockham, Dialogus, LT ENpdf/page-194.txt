fidei firmitate collegium apostolorum excellit. Hec
considerantibus vitam et mores eorum est tam nota quod
probacione non eget. Sed collegium apostolorum potuit
errare et erravit; tempore enim passionis Christi nullus
eorum fixus in fide remansit; ergo multo forcius
collegium cardinalium potest errare contra fidem.

cardinals does not excel the college of apostles in
sanctity or in firmness of faith. This is so well known
to those who consider their life and morals that it
does not need proof. But the college of apostles could
err and did err. For at the time of Christ's passion
none of them remained fast in faith. It is therefore
much more strongly the case that the college of
cardinals can err against faith. [Cf. ibid., p. 955,
quarto.]

Discipulus Ista racio non videtur concludere, quia
collegium apostolorum licet ante missionem Spiritus
Sancti erraverit tamen post dictam missionem non
erravit.

Student: That argument does not seem valid because
although the college of apostles erred before the
sending of the holy spirit it nevertheless did not do so
after that sending.

Magister Non videtur istis quod hoc impediat
argumentum, quia collegium apostolorum non solum
post missionem Spiritus Sancti sed eciam ante
passionem Christi uberiori gracia sanctitatis et veritatis
illuminacione maiori fulgebat quam collegium
cardinalium. Ipsos enim ante passionem Christus
multipliciter commendavit, dicens Matthei 5, "Vos estis
lux mundi." "Vos estis sal terre." et Iohannis 15 c., "Iam
non dicam vos servos quia servus nescit quid faciat
dominus eius. Vos autem dixi amicos, quia omnia
quecumque audivi a patre meo nota feci vobis." Et de
firmitate eos commendat Luce 22, "Vos estis qui
permansistis mecum in temptacionibus meis." Si igitur
apostoli, qui secundum beatum Gregorium comparantur
cedris, a fide poterant deviare, temerarie cardinales, qui
omni vento doctrine tanquam arundines agitantur,
dicuntur non posse a veritatis catholice tramite aberrare.

Master: It does not seem to them that this hinders the
argument because the college of apostles glittered
with a richer grace of sanctity and a greater
brightness of truth than the college of cardinals not
only after the sending of the holy spirit but even
before Christ's passion. For before his passion Christ
commended them in many ways, saying at Matthew
5[:14,13], "You are the light of the world", "You are
the salt of the earth", and at John 15[:15], "I will not
now call you servants, for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doth. But I have called you friends
because all things whatsoever I have heard of my
Father I have made known to you." And he
commends them for their firmness at Luke 22[:28],
"You are they who have continued with me in my
temptations." So if the apostles, who according to
blessed Gregory are compared to cedars, could turn
aside from the faith, it would be rash to say that the
cardinals, who like reeds are disturbed by every
breeze of teaching, can not stray from the path of
catholic truth.

Nono sic: nulla dignitas ecclesiastica viatorem
sanctificat nec inobliquabilem a fide constituit. Hoc ex
auctoritatibus superius allegatis probatur aperte; quod
eciam ex verbis Chrysostomi que ponuntur dist. 40, c.
Multi colligitur. Ait enim, "Non locus sanctificat
hominem." Et infra, "Qui bene sederit super cathedram
honorem cathedre accipit, qui male sederit iniuriam
cathedre facit." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi quod
dignitas ecclesiastica non attribuit sanctitatem, et per
consequens non confert impossibilitatem errandi contra
fidem. Sed tota multitudo cardinalium ante dignitatem
cardinalatus adeptam potuit errare contra fidem; ergo
eadem multitudo post dignitatem cardinalatus adeptam
potest errare contra fidem.

A ninth [argument is] the following. No ecclesiastical
dignity sanctifies a pilgrim or establishes him as
unable to turn aside from faith. This is clearly proved
by the texts cited above, and is gathered too from the
words of Chrysostom included in dist 40, c. Multi
[col.147]. For he says, "The place does not sanctify
the man ... He who sits rightly on his throne receives
the honour of the throne, he who sits unjustly does a
wrong to the throne." We are given to understand by
these words that an ecclesiastical dignity does not
bestow sanctity and, consequently, does not confer
the impossibility of erring against faith. But the
whole multitude of cardinals could have erred against
faith before acquiring the dignity of the cardinalate.
Therefore the same multitude can err against faith
after acquiring the dignity of the cardinalate.

Decimo sic: collegium eminencius et superius collegio
cardinalium, scilicet collegium archiepiscoporum et
episcoporum, potest contra fidem errare; ergo multo

A tenth [argument is] the following. A college which
is more eminent than and superior to the college of
cardinals, that is the college of archbishops and
