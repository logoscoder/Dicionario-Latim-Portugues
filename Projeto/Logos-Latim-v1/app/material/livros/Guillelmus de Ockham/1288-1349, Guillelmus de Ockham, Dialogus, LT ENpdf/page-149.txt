committit peccatum mortale, hoc tibi negatur, quia
potest quis peccare mortaliter etiam alium cogendo ad
bonum. Nam qui cogit alium vovere castitatem vel
paupertatem vel aliquid aliud supererogationis potest
peccare mortaliter quia talia suaderi possunt, imperari
non possunt. De talibus enim loquens Augustinus dicit
quod nemo cogitur legibus bene facere sed male facere
prohibetur.

forces another, but not to a mortal sin, does not
commit a mortal sin this is denied because someone
can sin mortally even by forcing another to do
something good. For he who forces another to make a
vow of chastity or poverty or something else which is
a supererogation can sin mortally, because such things
can be recommended by persuasion, but they can not
be ordered. For when he speaks about such matters
Augustine says that no one is forced by law to act well
but is prohibited from acting badly.

Discipulus Estne alius modus aliquem de pertinacia
convincendi?

Student Is there another way of convicting someone
of pertinacity?

Magister Nono potest de pertinacia et pravitate
haeretica quis convinci si cogit aliquem veritatem
catholicam abiurare aut poenis, minis vel praeceptis
catholicam veritatem negare compellit. Quod enim
cogens alios veritatem quamcunque catholicam
abiurare pertinax et haereticus sit censendus
ostenditur. Nam qui cogit alium veritatem catholicam
abiurare
cogit
eundem
haeresi
contrariae
irrevocabiliter adhaerere. Talis autem, sicut ex
praecedenti capitulo apparet, est pertinax et haereticus.
Ergo, etc. Et per eandem rationem ostenditur quod qui
cogit alios minis poenis vel praeceptis aliquam
veritatem catholicam negare est pertinax et haereticus
iudicandus.

Master Someone can be convicted of pertinacity and
heretical wickedness in a ninth way if he forces
someone to abjure a catholic truth, or by punishments,
threats or commands constrains him to deny a catholic
truth. For it is shown that someone forcing others to
abjure any catholic truth at all should be considered
pertinacious and a heretic. For he who forces another
to abjure a catholic truth forces that person to cling
irrevocably to its opposing heresy; such a person,
however, as is clear from the preceding chapter, is
pertinacious and a heretic. Therefore, etc. It is also
shown by the same argument that he who forces others
by threats, penalties or commands to deny some
catholic truth should be judged pertinacious and a
heretic.

Discipulus Potestne talis compellens per aliquam
ignorantiam excusari, puta si credit quod assertio
quam cogit alium abiurare vel negare sit haeretica?

Student Can a person of this kind be excused if he
compels through some ignorance, if he believes, for
instance, that the assertion which he forces the other to
abjure or deny is heretical?

Magister Dicitur quod talis per nullam potest
ignorantiam excusari, quia nullus valet absque
temeritate quomodolibet attentare cogere alium
iuramento, poenis, minis vel praeceptis aliquam
assertionem abiurare vel negare nisi sit certus
certitudine sufficienti quod non est consona veritati.
De assertione autem catholica nullus potest
certitudinem habere talem quod non est consona
catholice veritati. Ergo temerarie cogit alium abiurare
vel negare eandem. Temeritas autem in hoc casu
pertinaciae aequipollet. Ergo talis est pertinax et
haereticus reputandus.

[See Significant Variants, para. 21.] Master It is said
that a person of this kind can not be excused by any
ignorance because without being rash no one can
attempt to force another in any way at all, by an oath,
by penalties, threats or commands, to abjure or deny
some assertion unless he is with sufficient certitude
sure that it is not consistent with the truth; no one,
however, can have such certitude that a catholic
assertion is not consistent with catholic truth; therefore
he rashly forces another to abjure or deny the same; in
this case, however, rashness is equivalent to
pertinacity. A person of this kind, therefore, should be
regarded as pertinacious and a heretic.
