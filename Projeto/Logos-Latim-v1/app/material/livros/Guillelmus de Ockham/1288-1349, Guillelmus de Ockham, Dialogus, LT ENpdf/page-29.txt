that the authority of the church is sufficient for the
establishment of faith without divine scripture.
Item Agato papa, ut legitur dist. 19, c. Sic omnes, ait,
"Sic omnes apostolicae sedis sanctiones accipiendae
sunt, tanquam ipsius divina voce Petri firmatae." Ex
quibus verbis datur intelligi quod omnes sanctiones
apostolicae sedis sunt eiusdem auctoritatis cum
scripturis beati Petri, quae inter Scripturas Divinas
censentur. Ergo eis fides aequaliter est praebenda. Sed
in sanctionibus apostolicae sedis veritates plures
habentur quae in Scripturis Divinis minime sunt
insertae. Ergo pluribus aliis veritatibus est firmiter
adhaerendum.

Again, as we read in dist. 19, c. Sic omnes [col. 60],
Pope Agatho says, "All the sanctions of the apostolic
see should be accepted as though affirmed by the
divine voice of Peter himself." We are given to
understand by these words that all the sanctions of the
apostolic see are of the same authority as the writings
of blessed Peter, and these are considered to be among
the divine scriptures. Therefore faith should be shown
to them equally. But many truths are found among the
sanctions of the apostolic see which have not been
inserted in the divine scriptures. Therefore we should
adhere firmly to many other truths.

Item Nicolaus papa, ut habetur dist. 22, c. 1, ait, "Qui
autem Romanae ecclesiae privilegium ab ipso summo
omnium ecclesiarum capite traditum auferre conatur
hic proculdubio in haeresim labitur," et parum post,
"Hic est dicendus haereticus." Ex quo datur intelligi
quod qui non vult haereticus reputari necessario
credere debet quod Romana ecclesia super omnes alias
ab ipso Christo primatum accepit, de quo tamen in
Scriptura Divina nulla fit mentio. Ergo veritates
aliquae sunt credendae licet ex Scripturis Sacris inferri
non possint.

Again, as we find in dist. 22, c. 1, [col.73] Pope
Nicholas says, "However, he who tries to remove the
Roman church's privilege, conferred by that highest
head of all churches, slips undoubtedly into heresy....
This person should be called a heretic." We are given
to understand by this that he who does not want to be
regarded as a heretic should believe necessarily that
the Roman church received from Christ primacy over
all others. Yet no mention is made of this in divine
scripture. Some truths should be believed, therefore,
even though they can not be inferred from the sacred
scriptures.

In fulcimentum autem assertionis eiusdem isti rationes
adducunt, quarum prima ducit ad inconveniens, quia, si
solis Scripturis Divinis et his quae ex solis contentis in
eis possunt inferri adstringerentur christiani fidem
indubiam adhibere, sequeretur quod negare liceret
apostolos symbolum condidisse, beatum Petrum
Romanum pontificem fuisse, sedem beati Petri de
Antiochia Romam fuisse translatam, Romanos
pontifices beato Petro successisse, cum de his in
Scripturis Divinis nil legatur. Has tamen veritates
universalis ecclesia hactenus tenuit, praedicavit, et
docuit, et per consequens ecclesia universalis errasset,
quod omnis catholicus pro inconvenienti debet habere.

Moreover, to support that assertion they adduce
arguments. The first of these leads to an irrationality
because, if christians were bound to offer undoubting
faith only to the divine scriptures and to those things
which can be inferred solely from what is contained in
them, it would follow that it would be permissible to
deny that the apostles were the authors of the creed,
that blessed Peter was Roman pontiff, that blessed
Peter's see was transferred from Antioch to Rome, and
that the Roman pontiffs succeeded Peter, since we
read nothing about these in the divine scriptures. Yet
the universal church has held, preached, and taught
these truths up to this time, and consequently the
universal church would have erred, something which
every catholic ought to hold as irrational.

Secunda ratio est haec. Non minus catholici tenentur
determinationibus et diffinitionibus Romanorum
pontificum, cum nihil contra fidem diffiniunt
orthodoxam, credulitate indubia assentire quam
astringantur eorum statutis quando nihil contra Dei
voluntatem praecipiunt obedire. Sed omnibus statutis
Romanorum pontificum quando nihil contra Dei
praecipiunt voluntatem oportet cum omni humilitate et
reverentia obedire, sicut per sacros canones, ut habetur
dist. 12, c. 1 et c. Praeceptis, et alibi in decretis
capitulis
innumeris,
constat
aperte.
Ergo
determinationibus et diffinitionibus Romanorum

A second argument is this. Catholics are no less
bound to assent with undoubting belief to the
determinations and definitions of Roman pontiffs
when they define nothing against orthodox faith, than
they are bound to obey their statutes when they
command nothing against God's will. But it is
necessary to obey with all humility and reverence all
the statutes of Roman pontiffs when they command
nothing against God's will, as is clearly established by
the sacred canons, as we find in dist. 12, c. 1 [col. 27]
and c. Praeceptis [col.27] and in numerous chapters
elsewhere in the decretals. Therefore it is necessary to
