of heaven, the authority of binding and loosing and
the power of consecrating the body of Christ and
having an ecclesiastical hierarchy.
Sed tenentes quod tota multitudo clericorum potest
hereticari dicunt quod quamvis omnes clerici
hereticarentur, propter hoc ecclesia potestatem habendi
predicta nequaquam amitteret, licet illa numquam
posset habere per humanam potenciam sed per
miraculosam operacionem divinam. Deus enim posset,
si omnes clerici essent facti heretici, diversis modis de
aliquibus laicis catholicis sacerdotes et episcopos
ordinare. Sola enim voluntate posset hoc facere, quod
eciam posset sue ecclesie revelare. Qua revelacione
facta et per miraculum confirmata, omnes catholici
deberent taliter ordinatos a Deo sicut veros episcopos et
sacerdotes habere.

But those who maintain that the whole multitude of
the clergy can become heretical say that even if all
the clergy were to become heretical the church would
not on that account lose the power of having the
things referred to above, although it could never have
them by human power but by the miraculous working
of the divine. For if all the clergy were to become
heretics God could in various ways ordain priests and
bishops from some lay catholics. For he could do this
by his will alone and could reveal it to his church too.
Once this revelation occurred and was confirmed by
a miracle all catholics would be bound to consider
those so ordained by God as true bishops and priests.

Discipulus Istud non est probabile quod Deus taliter
episcopos et sacerdotes ordinaret.

Student: It is not likely that God would ordain
bishops and priests in that way.

Magister Dicunt isti quod sicut temerarium est asserere
quod Deus taliter episcopos et sacerdotes ordinabit, ita
eciam temerarium est hoc negare, quia hoc esset de
futuris temere divinare. Dicere vero quod Deus non
possit hoc facere reputant heresim manifestam, quia in
articulum fidei de omnipotencia Dei impudenter
impingit.

Master: They say that just as it is rash to affirm that
God will ordain bishops and priests in this way, so
also is it rash to deny this, because this would be
rashly to predict future events. Indeed they regard it
as a manifest heresy to say that God can not do this
because it impudently strikes against an article of
faith about God's omnipotence.

Discipulus Dic responsionem istorum ad ultimum
medium.

Student: Tell me their reply to the last reason.

Magister Ad ultimum respondetur quod qui separat se a
tota multitudine clericorum quando sunt catholici non
potest cum ecclesia Dei pacem habere. Et in hoc casu
debent intelligi verba Cypriani. Quando autem omnes
clerici essent heretici, qui non separaret se ab eorum
collegio, saltem spiritualiter, et ignorancia probabili
minime laboraret, cum ecclesia Dei pacem nequaquam
haberet.

Master: Their reply to the last is that whoever
separates himself from the multitude of the clergy
when they are catholic can not have peace with the
church of God. And it is about such a case that
Cyprian's words should be understood. When all the
clergy were heretics, however, whoever did not
separate himself from their college, at least
spiritually, and was not labouring under probable
ignorance, would not have peace with the church of
God.

Capitulum 32

Chapter 32

Discipulus Licet teneam quod tota multitudo
clericorum non possit contra fidem errare, nolo te tamen
ad raciones in contrarium respondere quia conabor per
meditacionem propriam responsiones ad ipsas
racionabiles invenire, de quibus post presentis operis
complecionem intendo tecum collacionem habere. Nunc
autem quia videbaris innuere aliquos affirmare quod
tota multitudo virorum, et clericorum et laicorum, potest
contra fidem errare, peto ut aliqua motiva pro dicta
assercione invenire nitaris.

Student: Although I maintain that the whole
multitude of the clergy can not err against faith, I
nevertheless do not want you to reply to the
arguments to the contrary because I will try to find
reasonable responses to them by my own meditation.
I intend to have a discussion with you about them
after the completion of this present work. Now,
however, since you seemed to imply that some
people affirm that the whole multitude of men, both
clergy and lay, can err against faith, I beg you to try
to find some reasons for that assertion.
