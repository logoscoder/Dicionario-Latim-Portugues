condempnati super haeretica pravitate". In quibus
verbis de pertinacia nulla fit mentio. Quicunque ergo
praedicat publice contra fidem Catholicam, licet non
pertinaciter erret, hereticus est censendus.

before their prelates, or have been condemned
judicially by them on a charge of heretical
wickedness". In these words there is no mention of
pertinacity. Anyone, therefore, who preaches publicly
against the Catholic faith, even if he does not err
pertinaciously, must be considered a heretic.

Hoc idem Caelestinus Papa, ut recitat Nicolaus Papa,
sentire videtur, qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Ait
Caelestinus [c. 35, col. 980], ait: "Si quis ab episcopo
Nestorio aut ab aliis qui eum sequuntur, ex quo talia
praedicare coeperunt, vel excommunicatus vel exutus
est seu antistitis seu clerici dignitate, hunc in nostra
communione et durasse et durare manifestum est, nec
iudicamus eum esse remotum, quia non poterat
quemquam eius removere sententia qui iam se
praebuerat ipse removendum". Ex his verbis datur
intelligi quod quam cito aliquis incipit praedicare contra
Catholicam veritatem, tam cito excommunicandi alios
potestatem amittit. Ex quo sequitur quod talis est
haereticus reputandus. Et tamen absque pertinacia
potest aliqua praedicare contraria Catholicae veritati.
Ergo ad hoc quod aliquis sit censendus haereticus non
requiritur quod pertinaciter dubitet aut erret.

Pope Celestine, as Pope Nicholas reports, seems to
think the same. As we read in 24, q. 1, c. Ait
Celestinus, he says: "If anyone has been
excommunicated or stripped of his office as bishop or
cleric by Bishop Nestorius or by others who follow him
(from when they began to preach such things), it is
manifest that this man remains and has remained in our
communion, and we do not judge him to have been
removed; because it was not possible for anyone to
remove another by his sentence if he had already
shown that he himself should be removed". By these
words we are given to understand that as soon as
someone begins to preach against Catholic truth, he
straightway loses the power to excommunicate others.
From this it follows that such a person should be
regarded as a heretic. And yet someone can preach
things contrary to Catholic truth without pertinacity.
Therefore for it to be the case that someone should be
considered a heretic it is not required that he err or
doubt pertinaciously.

Hoc etiam Beatus Hieronymus, ut habetur 24, q. 1,
Haec est fides, testari videtur, cum ait, scribens papae:
"Si autem haec nostra confessio Apostolatus tui iudicio
comprobatur, quicunque me culpare voluerit se
imperitum aut malivolum vel etiam non Catholicum sed
haereticum comprobabit". Hic etiam de pertinacia nulla
fit mentio. Ergo superflue ponitur "pertinaciter" in
diffinitione praedicta.

Blessed Jerome also seems to testify to this. As we read
in 24, q. 1, Haec est fides [col.970], he says, writing to
a pope, "But if this confession of ours is approved by
the judgment of your Apostleship, whoever wants to
blame me will prove himself unskilled or malevolent or
even not a Catholic but a heretic". Here also there is no
mention of pertinacity. Therefore it is superfluous to
put "pertinaciously" in the above definition.

Item, nullus nisi haereticus involvitur damnatione
haereticorum. Sed teste Gelasio, 24, q. 1, c. 1 [col. 966],
"Quicunque in haeresim semel damnatam labitur, eius
damnatione seipsum involvit", ubi papa inter labentem
pertinaciter vel non pertinaciter in haeresim semel
damnatam non distinguit, et per consequens nec nos
debemus distinguere. Ergo quicunque, sive pertinaciter
sive non pertinaciter, labitur in haeresim semel
damnatam haereticus est censendus.

Also, no one except a heretic is entangled in the
condemnation of heretics. But, on the testimony of
Gelasius, 24, q. 1, c. 1, "Whoever falls into a heresy at
any time condemned entangles himself in its
condemnation", where the pope does not distinguish
between one who falls pertinaciously, or not
pertinaciously, into a heresy at any time condemned,
and, consequently, neither should we distinguish.
Therefore, whoever falls, whether pertinaciously or not
pertinaciously, into a heresy at any time condemned
should be reckoned a heretic.

Hoc idem Gelasius, ut habetur in eisdem c. et q., c.
Maiores, aperte videtur asserere, dicens: "Auctore
cuiuslibet insanie ac pariter errore damnato sufficere
iudicarunt, ut quisquis huiusmodi erroris aliquando
communicator existeret principali sententia damnationis
eius esset astrictus".

Gelasius also seems to assert this openly, as we read in
the same causa and question, c. Maiores [col.966]. He
says: "Once the author of any insanity, and likewise the
error, has been condemned, they judged it to be enough
that whoever should at any time share in this error
would be bound by the original sentence of its
condemnation".

Cui Felix papa, ut habetur eisdem c. et q., c. Achatius
secundus, concordare videtur, dicens: "Itaque necesse
est ut in illam iusta lance sententiam recideret quam
cum suis successoribus per convenientiam synodalem

Pope Felix seems to agree with him. As we read in the
same causa and question, c. Achatius (ii) [col.966], he
says: "It is therefore necessary that he fell into the
sentence (if the scales are just) that the author of the
