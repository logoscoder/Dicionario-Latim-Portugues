Student Finally, let us discuss briefly
whether someone elected as king or
emperor can and should, by virtue of the
fact that he has been elected, involve
himself by right in arranging the temporal
affairs of the kingdom before his election
has been presented or even notified to the
pope.

SHOULD AN ELECTED SECULAR RULER ADMINISTER AT ONCE, OR WAIT TO NOTIFY THE POPE?

Magister Ad hoc secundum diversas opiniones
quae recitatae sunt superius diversimode
respondetur. Nam secundum illos qui dicunt
quod imperium est a papa electus nullam
administrationem habet de iure antequam
confirmetur a papa. Secundum illos qui dicunt
quod imperium non est a papa plus quam
regnum Franciae vel regnum aliud quodcunque
fidelium {*vel infidelium add. &MzNaPeRe}

CHAPTER 29

Master Different replies are made to this
according to the different opinions recorded
above. For according to those who say that
the empire is from the pope, the one elected
has no [right of] administration before he is
confirmed by the pope. According to those
who say that the empire is no more from
the pope than is the kingdom of France or
any other kingdom of believers or
unbelievers and that the emperor is no more
subject to the pope in temporal affairs than
the king of France or anyone else at all, one
elected as king or emperor of the Romans
has the full [right of] administration in
temporal affairs by the very fact that he has
been elected without this election being
presented or notified to the pope and he can
and should involve himself in the empire or
Roman kingdom, unless the Romans or
those to whom the Romans have transferred
their authority, right and power have
ordained [[grammar requires ordinatum
erit, doesn't it?]] for some reason for the
common good that before the one who has
been elected involves himself in the
kingdom or empire he should be presented
to the pope, just as sometimes the election
of the pope was presented to the emperor
