probatur apertis. Nam Graeci negantes Spiritum
Sanctum procedere a Filio ante assertionis
damnationem eorum non fuerunt heretici reputati; qui
tamen post damnationem eiusdem inter haereticos
deputantur. Assertores etiam opinionis Ioachim a
concilio generali damnatae post damnationem haeretici
iudicantur, ipse tamen abbas Ioachim, quamvis ante
damnationem assertionem eandem tenuerit, non fuit
haereticus, ut habetur Extra, De summa trinitate et fide
catholica c. Damnamus. Similiter qui post
constitutionem Alexandri 3 quae habetur Extra, De
haereticis c. Cum Christus tenuerint quod Christus non
est aliquid secundum quod homo fuerunt haeretici
iudicandi secundum quod glossa notat ibidem, qui
tamen antea pro haereticis minime habebantur. Patet
igitur quod pro nonnullis assertionibus non sunt
assertores ante damnationem haeretici reputandi qui
tamen post damnationem inter haereticos computantur.

minor is proved by clear examples. For the Greeks,
who deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son,
were not regarded as heretics before the condemnation
of their assertion, yet after its condemnation they were
considered to be among the heretics. Those too who
affirm Joachim's opinion which was condemned by a
general council were judged to be heretics after its
condemnation, yet Abbot Joachim himself was not a
heretic, as we find in Extra, De summa trinitate et fide
catholica, c. Damnamus [col.6], although he
maintained the same assertion before its
condemnation. Similarly those who, after Alexander
III's constitution which is found in Extra, De hereticis,
c. Cum Christus [col.779], held that Christ is not
anything as a man, should have been judged as
heretics, according to what the gloss notes at that
point [s. v. sub anathemate; col.1671]. Yet before that
they were not considered as heretics. It is clear,
therefore, with regard to some assertions that their
affirmers should not be regarded as heretics before
their condemnation, yet after their condemnation they
are counted among heretics.

Secundo sic. Ille ad quem pertinet autentice diffinire
quae assertio catholica, quae haeretica est censenda, de
assertione non catholica catholicam et de assertione
non haeretica haereticam facere potest, quia aliter
diffinitio sua nihil videretur penitus operari plus quam
diffinitio vel determinatio doctoris qui per auctoritates
vel rationes declarat et probat quae assertio in rei
veritate est catholica et quae haeretica aestimanda. Sed
ad summum pontificem non solum per modum
docentis vel doctrinae sed etiam autentice pertinet
diffinire quae assertio catholica quaeve haeretica est
censenda. Ergo summus pontifex de assertione non
catholica catholicam et de assertione non haeretica
haereticam facere potest.

Secondly as follows: He to whom it pertains to define
by authority which assertion should be considered
catholic and which heretical can make catholic an
assertion which is not catholic and heretical an
assertion which is not heretical, because otherwise his
definition would seem to have no more effect at all
than the definition or determination of a teacher who
declares and proves by authorities or arguments which
assertion should in truth of fact be regarded as
catholic and which as heretical. But it pertains to the
highest pontiff to define not only by way of teaching
or doctrine but also by authority which assertion
should be considered catholic or which heretical.
Therefore the highest pontiff can make catholic an
assertion which is not catholic and heretical an
assertion which is not heretical.

Discipulus Istae duae rationes apparentiam habere
videntur, tamen conclusio est mihi difficilis ad
tenendum. Unde si aliqui asserunt contrarium tibi
placeat explicare.

Student Those two arguments seem plausible, yet the
conclusion is difficult for me to hold. If some people
affirm the opposite, therefore, would you please set it
forth.

Magister Sunt nonulli dicentes quod sicut quantum ad
ea quae spectant ad fidem nostram et nequaquam ex
voluntate humana dependent non potest summus
pontifex nec etiam tota ecclesia Dei de assertione non
vera facere veram nec de assertione non falsa facere
falsam, ita non potest de assertione non catholica
facere catholicam nec de assertione non heretica facere
hereticam; et ideo non potest novum articulum fidei
facere nec de non haeresi potest facere haeresim
quoquo modo, quia sicut catholicae veritates absque

Master There are some people who say that just as
with respect to those things that pertain to our faith
and do not depend on human will, the highest pontiff
can not, nor can even the whole church of God, make
true an assertion that is not true nor false an assertion
that is not false, so he can not make catholic an
assertion that is not catholic nor heretical an assertion
that is not heretical; and therefore he can not make a
new article of faith nor in any way at all make a
heresy of what is not a heresy, because just as without
