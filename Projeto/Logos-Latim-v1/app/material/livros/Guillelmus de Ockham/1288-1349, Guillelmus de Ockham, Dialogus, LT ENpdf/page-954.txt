Item imperator non est iudex episcoporum
inferiorum et clericorum, ut ex innumeris
canonibus sacris {*trs. &NaRe} colligitur.
Ergo non est iudex papae.

Again, the emperor is not the judge of lesser
bishops and clerics, as is gathered from
innumerable sacred canons. Therefore he is
not the judge of the pope.

CAP. XVII.

CHAPTER 17

Discipulus Istae allegationes pro assertione
praedicta sufficiant. Ideo ad assertionem
contrariam te converte.

Student Those arguments are enough in
support of the above assertion. Therefore turn
to the opposite assertion.

Magister Circa assertionem contrariam varii
sunt {*trs. &MzNaRe} modi ponendi.

Master There are various ways of putting the
opposite assertion.

Discipulus Recita illos modos {*trs.
&MzNaRe} varios.

Student Record those various ways.

14.27.1.1.1

Opinion 2A: The Emperor can judge any crime, ecclesiastical or secular, and hence can depose a
pope

Magister Unus modus ponendi est quod
imperator ratione imperatoriae maiestatis
{*dignitatis &NaRe} de omni crimine tam
ecclesiastico quam seculari habet iudicare et
papam {*trs. &MzNaRe} ipsum {primum
&Mz} si est probatum contra ipsum crimen
dignum depositione deponere.

Master One way of putting it is that by
reason of his imperial dignity the emperor has
the power to judge any crime, ecclesiastical
as much as secular, and to depose the pope
himself, if a charge worthy of deposition is
proved against him.

Discipulus Aliquas allegationes adducas ad
probandum quod imperator debet papam pro
omni crimine iudicare.

Student Bring forward some arguments to
prove that the emperor ought to judge the
pope for any crime.

Magister Ad hoc plures rationes sunt inductae
{*in add. &Re} [[interlinear]] prima {qua
&Re} [[corrected interlinear]] parte huius
dialogi libro 6 c. {*2 et add. &NaRe} 3 {*et
add. &NaRe} 4 et 5, quibus {*forte add.
&MzNaRe} non facile erit {*trs. &MzNaRe}
invenire fortiores. Ideo non videtur necesse
quod circa alias rationes adducendas me
fatiges {fatigeres &Mz}.

Master Many arguments were brought
forward for this in chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of
book 6 of the first part of this Dialogue, and it
will perhaps not be easy to find stronger ones
than these. It does not seem necessary,
therefore, for you to importune me about
bringing forward other arguments.

Discipulus Non est {*erit &NaRe} inutile ut
etiam rationes ibi factas aliter quam ibi
tractemus. Ideo alias {*illas &MzNaRe}

Student It will not be useless to consider
arguments made there in addition to others.
Would you cite those, therefore, and try to
