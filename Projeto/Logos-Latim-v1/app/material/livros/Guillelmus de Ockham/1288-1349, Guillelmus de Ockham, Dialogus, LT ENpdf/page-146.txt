any of these over him.
Discipulus Ponunt aliquam differentiam inter papam
corripientem et alios praelatos corripientes errantes?

Student Do they lay down any difference between the
pope and other prelates correcting those who err?

Magister Quantum ad haereses damnatas explicite
conformiter dicunt de papa et aliis praelatis, sed
quantum ad haereses damnatas dumtaxat implicite
magna differentia invenitur, quia super tenentes
haereses damnatas solummodo implicite praelati
inferiores summo pontifice nullam iurisdictionem
habere noscuntur ut eos punire possint vel ad aliquid
coartare. Sed si in suis conscientiis eos putaverint
pertinaces debent eos apostolico accusare vel
denunciare. Apostolicus autem eos potest examinare
et, si pertinaces invenerit, condemnare.

Master They say similar things about the pope and
other prelates with respect to explicitly condemned
heresies, but a great difference is found with respect to
heresies condemned only implicitly, because over
those holding heresies condemned only implicitly
prelates inferior to the highest pontiff are known to
have no jurisdiction that enables them to punish them
or compel them to do anything. But if in their own
conscience they think that they are pertinacious they
ought to accuse or denounce them before the pope.
The pope, however, can examine them and condemn
them if he finds them pertinacious.

Capitulum 25

Chapter 25

Discipulus Gestio scire si modus alius assignatur
errantem de pertinacia convincendi.

Student I long to know whether another way of
convicting of pertinacity someone erring is assigned.

Magister Octavo modo nonnullorum iudicio est quis
de pertinacia convincendus, puta si alios ad suum
pertinaciter
defendendum
errorem
praeceptis,
comminationibus, poenis, promissionibus, iuramentis
vel alio quovis modo artare molitur. Quod enim talis
pertinax et sit haereticus censendus multis rationibus
probare conantur.

Master In the judgement of some there is an eighth
way by which someone should be convicted of
pertinacity and that is if he endeavours to force others
by commands, threats, punishments, promises, oaths
or in any other way at all pertinaciously to defend his
error. That such a person should be considered
pertinacious and a heretic they try to prove by many
arguments.

Quarum prima est haec. Non minus delinquit qui alios
cogit ad haeresim pertinaciter defendendam quam qui
erranti consentit vel non resistit cum possit, quia talis
non solum est consentiens et non resistens sed etiam
cogens et impellens. Qui autem erranti et haeresim
pertinaciter defendenti consentit vel non resistit cum
potest consimili crimine irretitur, et per consequens
pertinax et haereticus est censendus. Ergo cogens seu
compellens alios haeresim pertinaciter defensare est
pertinax et haereticus reputandus. Maior est manifesta.
Minor sacris canonibus manifeste probatur. Ait enim
Isidorus, ut habetur11, q. 3, c. Qui consentit
peccantibus, "Alius pater ait, 'Si quis alterius errori
consentit, sciat se cum illo simili modo culpabilem
iudicandum.'" Et Leo papa, ut habetur Extra, De
haereticis, c. Qui alios, ait, "Qui alios cum potest ab
errore non revocat seipsum errare demonstrat." Et
Innocentius papa, ut habetur dist. 83, c. Error, ait,
"Error cui non resistitur approbatur, et veritas, cum
minime defensatur, opprimitur." Ex his aliisque
quampluribus aperte colligitur quod qui consentit
haereticae pravitati inter haereticos computatur. Ergo

This is the first. He who forces others to defend a
heresy pertinaciously commits no less a fault than he
who agrees with someone who errs or does not oppose
him when he can, because that person not only agrees
and does not oppose but even forces and insists. He
who agrees with or does not oppose when he can
someone erring and pertinaciously defending a heresy,
however, is entangled in the same crime and should be
considered, as a consequence, pertinacious and a
heretic. One who forces or compels others
pertinaciously to defend a heresy, therefore, should be
regarded as pertinacious and a heretic. The major
[premise] is obvious. The minor is proved clearly by
sacred canons. For, as we find in 11, q. 3, c. Qui
consentit peccantibus [col.671] Isidore says "Another
father says: 'If anyone agrees with another's error let
him know that he is to be judged as culpable in the
same way as that other.'" And Pope Leo, as we find in
Extra, De haereticis, c. Qui alios [col.778], says, "He
who does not call others back from error when he can
do so shows that he himself errs." And, as we find in
dist. 83, c. Error, Pope Innocent says, "An error which
