Spiritus observat, et se ab ecclesie vinculo atque a
sacerdotum collegio separat, episcopi nec potestatem
potest habere nec honorem, qui episcopatus nec
unitatem habere voluit nec pacem." Ex quibus verbis
datur intelligi quod qui separat se a collegio sacerdotum
nec honorem nec pacem nec unitatem cum ecclesia Dei
potest habere. Ergo tota multitudo clericorum, que
intelligitur nomine sacerdotum, contra fidem errare non
potest.

[col.568]. "Whoever, therefore, does not preserve
peaceful union and unity of the Spirit and separates
himself from the tie of the church and the college of
priests can have neither the power nor the honour of a
bishop since he has not wanted to have the unity or
peace appropriate to the episcopate." We are given to
understand by these words that whoever separates
himself from the college of priests can not have
honour, peace or unity with the church of God.
Therefore the whole multitude of the clergy, which is
understood by the word 'priests', can not err against
faith.

Discipulus Ista media pro assercione, quam arbitror
esse veram, michi sufficiunt, nec puto quod adversarii
ad ipsa responsiones invenire poterunt apparentes. Et
tamen, ut melius virtutem eorum intelligam, dic
quomodo ad ipsa adversarii respondere nituntur.

Student: Those means [of proof] of that assertion,
which I think is true, are enough for me, and I do not
think that their opponents could find persuasive
replies to them. And yet so that I might understand
their strength, tell me how those opponents try to
reply to them.

Replies to arguments that all the clergy can not err
Magister Primum omnino frivolum arbitrantur quia per
equivocacionem procedit. Nam hoc nomen ecclesia
habet varias significaciones. Quandoque enim accipitur
pro domo materiali, et sic accipitur 1 ad Corinthios 11
cum dicit Apostolus, "Nunquid domos non habetis ad
manducandum et bibendum aut ecclesiam Dei
contemnitis?" Secundo accipitur hoc nomen ecclesia
pro congregacione Christianorum fidelium, generali vel
particulari,
que
tam
viros
quam
mulieres
comprehendere potest. Et sic accipitur ecclesia Actuum
20 cum dicit Apostolus maioribus natu, "Atttendite
vobis et universo gregi, in quo vos Spiritus Sanctus
posuit episcopos, regere ecclesiam Dei", ubi nomen
ecclesie comprehendit tam viros quam mulieres, quia ad
episcopos non solum spectat regere viros sed eciam
mulieres. Sic eciam accipit Apostolus nomen ecclesie in
epistola ad Philemonem, cum dicit "ecclesie que in
domo tua est", quia in domo Philemonis erant tam viri
quam mulieres, et forte nullus clericus erat in ea nisi
Archippus fortassis, quia nec ipse Philemon preditus
erat ecclesiastica dignitate. Sic eciam semper accipit
Apostolus in aliis suis epistolis ecclesiam. Et isto modo
accipitur ecclesia Proverbiorum 5 cum dicitur, "Pene fui
in omni malo in medio ecclesie et synagoge." Sic eciam
accipitur ecclesia De consecracione dist. 1, c. Ecclesia,
ubi dicit Nicolaus papa, "Ecclesia, id est catholicorum
colleccio, quomodo sine apostolice sedis institueretur
nutu, quando iuxta sacra decreta nec ipsa debet absque
precepcione pape basilica noviter construi, que ipsam
catholicorum
intra
semet
amplecti
catervam
dinoscitur?" Ubi ecclesia accipitur pro colleccione
catholicorum, que mulieres et laicos nequaquam
excludit. In duabus significacionibus predictis dicunt

[See Significant Variants, para. 40.]Master: They
think that the first one is entirely frivolous because it
proceeds by ambiguity. For this word 'church' has
various senses. For sometimes it is taken as the
material building, and it is taken that way in 1
Corinthians 11[:22] when the Apostle says, "What,
have you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or
despise ye the church of God ... ?" Secondly, the
word 'church' is taken as the congregation of
Christian believers, general or particular, which can
include both men and women. And 'church' is taken
that way in Acts 20[:28] when the Apostle says to the
elders, "Take heed to yourselves and to the whole
flock, wherin the Holy Ghost hath placed you
bishops, to rule the church of God", where the word
'church' includes both men and women, because it
does not pertain to bishops to rule men only, but also
women. The Apostle also takes the word 'church' in
this sense in his letter to Philemon [v.2] where he
speaks of "the church which is in thy house", because
in Philemon's house there were both men and women
and no cleric perhaps, except possibly Archippus,
because Philemon himself was not endowed with an
ecclesiastical dignity. The Apostle always takes
'church' in that sense in his other letters too. 'Church'
is taken in that way in Proverbs 5[:14] too which
says, "I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of
the church and the congregation." 'Church' is also
taken that way in De consecratione, dist. 1, c.
Ecclesia, where Pope Nicholas says [col.1296],
"How would a church, that is a gathering of catholics,
be established without the assent of the apostolic see,
when according to sacred decrees not even a basilica,
