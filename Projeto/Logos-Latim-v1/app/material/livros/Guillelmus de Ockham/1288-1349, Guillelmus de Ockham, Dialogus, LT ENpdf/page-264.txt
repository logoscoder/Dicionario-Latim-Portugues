Omnibus enim hereticis et fautoribus eorum ac

eciam per duos vel tres aut 12 vel 20 seu plures quos
elegerit orthodoxos multiplicare plusquam umquam

umquam habuerint regiones, infidelibus extirpatis,

nolunt, cum se spiritum prophecie habere non reputant,
divinare. Et ideo concedunt, quemadmodum predixisti,
quod non est credendum quod umquam infideles totam
Christianitatem occupabunt; nec est credendum quod
totam christianitatem nullatenus occupabunt; neutrum
enim est certum nisi Deo et cui Deus revelavit, quamvis
dicant nonnulli quod tempore antichristi tanta erit
persecucio et extinccio catholicorum quod omnis regio
in universo orbe erit per infideles vel apostatas
occupata. Et an simile quid eveniet vel non eveniet ante
tempora antichristi, dicunt quod per Scripturam
Divinam vel doctrinam universalis ecclesie sciri non
potest.

great part of the world to the faith through a few
disciples. And so some people say that if the
Saracens or other unbelievers invade Christianity it
will be rash for Christians to presume that they are to
be protected by divine power, if they have neglected
to purify their lands, throughout every part of which
by now have spread heresies, simony, persecutions,
slanders and false charges against the innocent,
violent judgements, wars, disagreements and discords
about possessions, lordships and rights, occupations
and invasions of things belonging to others,
ambitions, favouritism of persons, impious and
wicked distribution of honours, anger, envy and
injustices and innumerable other spiritual and carnal
vices with which all, or almost all, of Christianity
seems to be infected. For if all the heretics and those
who favour them and those involved in other evils
are killed and the lands of all Christians are occupied
by unbelievers God will also be able by means of two
or three or 12 or 20 or more of the orthodox whom he
will choose to increase Christians and holy land more
than ever before and, with the unbelievers rooted out,
to subject more lands than they ever had before to
their control. Nevertheless they refuse to predict what
will happen about those matters since they do not
regard themselves as having the spirit of prophecy.
And therefore they grant, as you said before, that it
should not be believed that unbelievers will ever
occupy the whole of Christianity; nor should it be
believed that they will not occupy the whole of
Christianity; for neither [of these alternatives] is
certain except to God and anyone to whom God has
revealed it, even if some people say that in the time
of anti-Christ the persecution and annihilation of
catholics will be so great that every region
throughout the whole world will be occupied by
unbelievers and apostates. And they say that it can
not be known from divine scripture or the teaching of
the universal church whether something similar will
happen or will not happen before the times of antiChrist.

Discipulus Certum est quod fides Christi usque ad
finem seculi permanebit. Ergo certum est quod
numquam infideles totam Christianitatem occupabunt.

Student: It is certain that faith in Christ will persist
to the end of the age. Therefore it is certain that
unbelievers will never occupy the whole of
Christianity.

Magister Respondent dicentes quod male arguis, quia
fides Christi poterit remanere in catholicis dispersis et
latitantibus in terris ab infidelibus occupatis,
quemadmodum nunc Iudei aliqui et Sarraceni, licet
publice in terris Christianorum manent.

Master: They reply by saying that you are arguing
badly, because faith in Christ will be able to persist
among catholics who are scattered and hiding in the
lands occupied by unbelievers, just as it is now with
some Jews and Saracens, (although they remain
publicly in the lands of Christians).
