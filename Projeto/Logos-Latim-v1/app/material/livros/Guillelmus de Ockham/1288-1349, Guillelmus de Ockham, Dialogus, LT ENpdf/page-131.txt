of the scriptures.
Quod etiam ratione eiusdem Gratiani ostenditur quam
ponit sub his verbis "Quo quisque maiori ratione nititur
eo maioris auctoritatis eius verba esse videntur. Plurimi
autem tractatorum, sicut pleniori gratia Spiritus Sancti,
ita ampliori scientia aliis praecellentes rationi magis
adhaesisse probantur. Unde nonnullorum pontificum
constitutis Augustini, Hieronymi atque aliorum
tractatorum dicta videntur esse praeferenda." His verbis
ostenditur quod in his quae ad fidem pertinent doctores
sunt pontificibus praeferendi, et ita, nisi correcti fuerint
ab eis legitime modo praeexposito, non tenentur
opiniones suas si fuerint erroneae revocare.

This is also shown (b) by an argument of the same
Gratian which he expresses in these words [dist 20.
para. Decretales; col.65], "Where anyone relies on
stronger reason, there his words seem to be of greater
authority. But many commentators, surpassing others
in ampler knowledge, just as they do in fuller grace of
the holy spirit, are shown to have adhered more to
reason. Whence it seems that the sayings of
Augustine, Jerome and other commentators should be
preferred to the constitutions of some pontiffs." These
words show that in matters that pertain to the faith
doctors should be preferred to pontiffs and so, unless
they have been legitimately corrected by them in the
previously explained way, they are not bound to
retract their opinions if they are erroneous.

Discipulus Ista ratio dupliciter videtur deficere.

Student That argument seems deficient in two ways.

Primo quod Gratianus loquitur de doctoribus ab
ecclesia approbatis, sicut de Augustino, Hieronymo et
aliis similibus, non de modernis doctoribus. Et ideo
licet isti sancti sint in expositionibus Scripturarum
pontificibus praeponendi, doctores tamen moderni
episcopis et inquisitoribus haereticae pravitatis praeferri
non debent.

First because Gratian is speaking about scholars
approved by the church, like Augustine, Jerome and
others like them, not about modern scholars.
Therefore, although those saints should be put ahead
of bishops in expositions of the scriptures, yet modern
doctors ought not be preferred to bishops and
inquisitors into heretical wickedness.

Secundo videtur deficere quia non sequitur: doctores
non debent suas opiniones ad correptionem
iurisdictionem habentis revocare nisi modo praedicto
fuerunt correcti legitime, ergo alii simplices correcti a
praelatis non debent revocare suos errores nisi fuerint
saepe dicto modo correcti legitime.

Second it seems deficient because this [argument]
does not follow: doctors ought not retract their
opinions at the correction of someone having
jurisdiction unless they have been legitimately
corrected in the aforesaid way; others, therefore,
simple people, corrected by prelates ought not retract
their errors unless they have been legitimately
corrected in the way often mentioned.

Magister Ad istas instantias, ut apparet ex praedictis,
est facile respondere.

Master It is easy to reply to those objections, as is
clear from what has been said.

Unde ad primam dicunt quod Gratianus non loquitur
solummodo de doctoribus ab ecclesia approbatis sed
etiam loquitur de aliis, sicut et loquitur de aliis
pontificibus quam de illis qui fuerunt temporibus
doctorum qui nunc sunt ab ecclesia approbati.
Comparat enim in genere statum doctorum ad statum
pontificum. Et ideo, sicut antiquitus doctores in
traditione eorum quae spectant ad fidem fuerunt
pontificibus praeferendi, ita et nunc sunt doctores
modernis pontificibus praeferendi, dummodo sint
doctores per scientiam excellentem et vitam laudabilem
non propter munera et preces vel favores humanos ad
magisterium sublimati. Unde, ut suam intentionem
aperte declarent, dicunt quod Gratianus non loquitur de
doctoribus prout his diebus nomen "doctoris" accipitur,
sed loquitur de intelligentibus Scripturae Divinae

So to the first they say that Gratian is speaking not
only of scholars approved by the church but also of
others, just as he is also speaking of pontiffs other
than those who lived in the times of the scholars who
are now approved by the church. For he is comparing
in general the status of doctors with the status of
pontiffs. And, therefore, just as of old doctors should
have been preferred to pontiffs in the handing on of
those matters which pertain to the faith so also now
doctors should be preferred to modern pontiffs, as
long as the doctors have been raised to their teaching
post by virtue of their excellent knowledge and
praiseworthy life, not by virtue of gifts and requests
or human favours. And thus, to make their intention
quite clear, they say that Gratian is not speaking of
doctors, as the word "doctor" is taken these days, but
