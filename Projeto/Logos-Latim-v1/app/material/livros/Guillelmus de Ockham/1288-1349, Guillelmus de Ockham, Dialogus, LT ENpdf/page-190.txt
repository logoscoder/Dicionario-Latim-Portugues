aliud habet potestatem eligendi summum pontificem,
qui est caput ecclesie, hereticari non potest, quia si illud
collegium esset hereticum esset privatum potestate
eligendi summum pontificem, quia heretici summum
pontificem non debent eligere, et per consequens tota
ecclesia careret potestate eligendi summum pontificem,
quod est inconveniens reputandum. Sed ad solum
collegium cardinalium spectat potestas eligendi
summum pontificem, ut ex decreto Nicolai pape quod
ponitur dist. 19 colligitur. Ergo collegium cardinalium
hereticari non potest.

alone and exclusively has the power to choose the
highest pontiff, who is the head of the church, can
not become heretical, because if that college were
heretical it would be deprived of the power to choose
the highest pontiff, since heretics ought not choose
the highest pontiff, and consequently the whole
church would lack the power to choose the highest
pontiff and this is to be regarded as unsuitable. But,
as we gather from a decree of Pope Nicholas
collected in dist. 19, the power to choose the highest
pontiff pertains to the college of cardinals alone;
therefore, the college of cardinals can not become
heretical.

Quarto sic: illud collegium ad quod spectat papam si
exorbitaverit a fide corrigere et iudicare non potest
contra fidem errare, quia si posset contra fidem errare
non esset papa eorum subiectus iudicio; ymmo eciam
alii Christiani non essent necessario eorum subiecti
iudicio in causa fidei, quia possent ab eis si erraverint
appellare; ergo multo forcius non esset papa eorum
subiectus iudicio. Sed collegium cardinalium potest de
papa heretico iudicare, quod probatur exemplo eorum
qui Anastasium secundum, ut habetur dist. 19.
repudiaverunt propter hereticam pravitatem; illi autem
fuerunt cardinales. Ergo ad cardinales spectat papam de
pravitate heretica iudicare, et per consequens collegium
cardinalium hereticari non potest.

A fourth [argument is] as follows. That college to
which it pertains to correct and judge the pope if he
deviates from the faith can not err against faith,
because if it could err against faith the pope would
not be subject to its judgement - indeed other
christians too would not necessarily be subject to its
judgement in a case concerning faith because they
could appeal from it if it erred; it is much more the
case, therefore, that the pope would not be subject to
its judgement. But the college of cardinals can judge
a heretical pope, as is proved by the example of those
who rejected Anastasius II for heretical wickedness,
as we find in dist. 19 [c.9; col.64]. However these
were cardinals. It pertains to cardinals, therefore, to
judge a pope in a matter of heretical wickedness, and
consequently the college of cardinals can not become
heretical.

Quinto sic: illud collegium hereticari non potest quo
hereticato tota multitudo Christianorum hereticaretur;
sed hereticato collegio cardinalium tota multitudo
christianorum hereticaretur, quia, ut habetur 6, q. 1,
para. Verum, "capite languescente facile reliqua
corporis membra inficiuntur". Collegium autem
cardinalium est caput Christianitatis; ergo hereticato
collegio cardinalium facile hereticaretur tota
Christianitas; sed tota Christianitas hereticari non
potest. Ergo nec collegium cardinalium hereticari non
potest.

A fifth [argument is] as follows. That college which
would cause the whole multitude of christians to
become heretical if it became heretical can not
become heretical; but if the college of cardinals
became heretical the whole multitude of christians
would become heretical because, as we find in 6, q.
1, para. Verum [col.559], "If the head becomes ill the
remaining members of the body easily become
infected." The college of cardinals is the head of
christianity, however, so if the college of cardinals
became heretical the whole of christianity would
easily become heretical. But the whole of
Christianity can not become heretical, and so the
college of cardinals can not become heretical either.

Sexto sic: si collegium cardinalium posset hereticari
multo magis quodlibet aliud collegium posset hereticari,
et ita nullum esset collegium Christianorum quod non
posset hereticam incurrere pravitatem. Quare tota
Christianitas posset heretica pravitate respergi, quod est
minime concedendum. Ergo collegium cardinalium
hereticari non potest.

A sixth [argument is] as follows. If the college of
cardinals could become heretical it is much more the
case that any other college at all could become
heretical, and so there would be no college of
christians which could not incur heretical
wickedness. As a result the whole of christianity
could be defiled with heretical wickedness, and this
is not to be conceded. Therefore the college of
cardinals can not become heretical.
