est que contra fidem errare non potest, quia de sola
militante universali ecclesia invenitur in scripturis
authenticis quod errare non potest. Concilium autem
generale, licet sit pars ecclesie universalis, non tamen
est ecclesia universalis. Ergo temerarium est dicere
quod concilium generale contra fidem errare non potest.

follows. There is only one church militant which can
not err against faith because only of the universal
church militant do we find in the authentic scriptures
that it can not err. A general council, however,
although it is part of the church militant, is
nevertheless not the universal church. It is rash to
say, therefore, that a general council can not err
against faith.

Discipulus Licet concilium generale non sit ecclesia
universalis, tamen representat ecclesiam universalem et
eius vices gerit, et ideo, sicut ecclesia universalis contra
fidem errare non potest, ita eciam concilium generale
contra fidem errare non potest.

Student: Although a general council is not the
universal church, it does nonetheless represent the
universal church and acts in its place. And therefore
just as the universal church can not err against faith,
so also a general council can not err against faith.

Magister Hec responsio impugnatur primo quia, sicut
concilium generale representat ecclesiam universalem et
eius vices gerit, ita eciam papa representat ecclesiam
universalem et eius vices gerit quia est persona publica
tocius communitatis gerens vices et curam. Sed papa
hoc non obstante potest contra fidem errare. Ergo et
generale concilium hoc non obstante poterit contra
fidem errare. Secundo quia non omni prerogativa
gaudet persona vel collegium que vel quod gerit vices
alterius qua gaudet communitas cuius vicem gerit. Ergo
ex hoc quod ecclesia universalis non potest contra
fidem errare inferri non potest quod concilium generale
non potest contra fidem errare, licet gerat vices
universalis ecclesie.

Master: This reply is attacked firstly because just as
a general council represents the universal church and
acts in its place, so the pope too represents the
universal church and acts in its place because he is a
public person acting in place of and having oversight
over the whole community. But notwithstanding this
the pope can err against faith. Therefore a general
council too, notwithstanding this, can err against
faith. [It is attacked] secondly because a person or
college who or which acts in the place of another
does not enjoy every prerogative which the
community in whose place he or it acts enjoys. From
the fact that the universal church can not err against
faith, therefore, it can not be inferred that a general
council can not err against faith, though it does act in
place of the universal church.

Secunda racio est hec. Illa congregacio que potest
voluntate humana dissolvi potest contra fidem errare,
quia illa ecclesia que contra fidem errare non potest
usque ad finem seculi permanebit iuxta promissionem
Christi Matthei ultim. Sed concilium generale potest
voluntate humana dissolvi, sicut et dissolvitur. Ergo
generale concilium potest contra fidem errare.

A second argument is this. That congregation that
can be dissolved by human will can err against faith
because that church which can not err against faith
will last until the end of the age according to Christ's
promise in the last chapter of Matthew [28:28]. But a
general council can be dissolved by human will, as
indeed it is dissolved. Therefore a general council
can err against faith.

Tercia racio est hec. Ille persone que in diversis locis
existentes possunt contra fidem errare, eciam si ad
eundem locum convenerint, poterunt contra fidem
errare, quia concursus ad eundum locum non reddit
aliquos inobliquabiles a fide, quia, sicut locus non
sanctificat homines, ita locus nullos confirmat in fide.
Sed omnes ad generale concilium convenientes
antequam convenirent poterant contra fidem errare, quia
si conveniunt 100 vel 200 episcopi constat quod omnes
ex arbitrio voluntatis poterant hereticam incidere
pravitatem. Ergo et postquam convenerint poterunt labi
in hereticam pravitatem.

A third argument is this. Those people living in
various places who can err against faith will be able
to err against faith even if they gather together in the
same place, since coming together in the same place
does not make anyone unable to turn aside from faith,
because, just as a place does not sanctify people, so a
place does not confirm anyone in faith. But all those
who come together at a general council were able to
err against faith before they came together because if
100 or 200 bishops come together it is certain that all
of them could have fallen into heretical wickedness
by a choice of their will. Therefore they will also be
able to fall into heretical wickedness after they have
come together.

Discipulus Ista racio non procedit quia Deus specialiter

Student: That argument is not valid because God
