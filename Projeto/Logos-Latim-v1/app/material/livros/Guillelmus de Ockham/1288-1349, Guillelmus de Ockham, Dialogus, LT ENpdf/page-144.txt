though at some time he erred in faith." [s. v.
corrigenda; col.14] So too, although the opinions
which Peter John [Olivi] left in his writings have been
condemned as heretical, he was, nevertheless, not
judged to be either pertinacious or a heretic. In the
same way, although blessed Jerome also wrote
heretical opinions which also we do not read of his
revoking, he was not regarded as a heretic.

Discipulus Secundum illa videtur quod nullus post
mortem posset de haeresi accusari, cuius tamen
contrarium asserunt sacri canones manifeste.

Disciple It seems from this that no one could be
accused of heresy after his death; the sacred canons,
however, openly assert the opposite of this.

Magister Respondetur quod propter hoc solummodo
quod quis haeresim tenuerit verbo vel scripto non esset
post mortem de haeresi accusandus de haeresi. Sed si
quocumque modo potest probari quod haeresim verbo
vel scripto tenuerit pertinaciter, post mortem poterit de
haeresi accusari, quia si per alium modum quam per
verba vel scripta solam haeresim exprimentia, puta per
verba vel scripta vel facta declarantia pertinaciam,
valuerit ostendi pertinax fuisse, est damnandus.

Master The reply to this is that no one should be
accused of heresy after his death solely because he
held a heresy in speech or writing. But if it can be
proved in any way at all that he pertinaciously held a
heresy in speech or writing he can be accused of
heresy after his death, because if he could be shown to
have been pertinacious in some other way than by
speeches or writings expressing only a heresy -- by
speeches, writings or deeds expressing pertinacity, for
instance -- he should be condemned.

Discipulus De hoc ponas exemplum ut quod dicitur
magis intelligam?

Disciple Would you give an example of this so that I
may understand better what is said?

Magister Si de aliquo post mortem probatum extiterit
quod verbo vel scripto tenuerit duas personas fuisse in
Christo non est propter hoc solummodo haereticus
reputandus, sed per simplicitatem vel ignorantiam
poterit excusari. Si autem probatum fuerit quod
sciverit dictam assertionem esse damnatam et quod
postea eam verbo vel scripto tenuerit, est de pertinacia
et pravitate haeretica condemnandus.

Master If it is proved of someone after his death that
he held in speech or writing that there were two
persons in Christ he should not be regarded as a
heretic solely on account of this, but he can be excused
by simplicity or ignorance. If it is proved, however,
that he knew that that assertion was condemned and
that afterwards he held it in speech or writing he
should be condemned for pertinacity and heretical
wickedness.

Discipulus Ut conicio, secundum istos eodem modo
contra vivum et mortuum de haeresi accusatum oportet
procedere, inquisitoribus tamen sufficit quod
tantummodo probetur aliquem mortuum verbo vel
scripto haeresim tenuisse.

Disciple As I surmise, it is necessary, according to
these people, to proceed in the same way against the
living and the dead accused of heresy, yet it is enough
for inquisitors that it be proved only that someone
dead held a heresy in speech or writing.

Magister De inquisitoribus dicunt isti quod saepe
inique procedunt et quod sunt ecclesiae Dei valde
nocivi tanquam lucris temporalibus totaliter inhiantes.

Master They say that inquisitors often proceed
wickedly and that they are very harmful to the church
of God, by concentrating entirely on their temporal
gains.

Discipulus Dicas nunc de correcto a socio vel alio qui
super ipsum nullam iurisdictionem penitus noscitur
obtinere?

Disciple Would you speak now about someone
corrected by a companion or another person who is
known to hold no jurisdiction over him at all?

Magister Dicunt praedicti quod correctus legitime de
haeresi a socio vel a subdito vel a quocunque alio

Master These people say that someone legitimately
corrected of heresy by a companion, a subject or
