veritatem. Beatus autem Ambrosius loquebatur pro
tempore suo quando ecclesia Romana firma mansit in
fide. Si autem erraret contra fidem, dissencientes ab ea
essent inter catholicos numerandi.

should not be counted among catholics; but if it were
to err against faith, this would not be true. However
blessed Ambrose was talking for his own time when
the Roman church remained firm in faith. If it were
to err against faith, however, those dissenting from it
should be numbered among catholics.

Ad quintam racionem dicitur quod aliquem esse extra
Romanam ecclesiam dupliciter potest intelligi: vel quia
est contrarius pertinaciter quantum ad ea que fidei sunt,
vel quia non est Romanus sed est de alia ecclesia
particulari. Qui primo modo est extra Romanam
ecclesiam, quamdiu Romana ecclesia non errat, non
potest nisi redierit salvari, et sic loquitur Hieronimus.
Qui secundo modo est extra ecclesiam Romanam
salvari potest. Hieronimus autem principaliter loquitur
de papa successore beati Petri catholico, et de illo habet
veritatem, quia quicumque est sibi contrarius
pertinaciter in hiis que fidei sunt salvari non potest.

It is said to the fifth argument that someone's being
outside the Roman church can be understood in two
ways: either he is pertinaciously opposed [to it] with
respect to matters of faith, or he is not a Roman but is
from some other particular church. As long as the
Roman church does not err, whoever is outside it in
the first way can not be saved unless he returns to it,
and Jerome is speaking in this sense. Someone
outside the Roman church in the second way can be
saved. But Jerome is mainly speaking about a pope
who is a catholic successor to blessed Peter, and it is
true about him, because whoever is pertinaciously
opposed to him in matters of faith can not be saved.

Ad sextam racionem dicitur quod beatus Cyprianus
loquitur de cathedra Petri que est summus pontifex
catholicus tenens fidem beati Petri, sive fuerit Rome,
sive Anciochie. Innocencius autem 3, ut de se patet,
loquitur de successoribus beati Petri catholicis.

It is said to the sixth argument that blessed Cyprian is
speaking about the see of Peter which is the highest
pontiff maintaining as a catholic the faith of blessed
Peter, whether at Rome or Antioch. Moreover, as is
patently obvious, Innocent III is speaking about
catholic successors of blessed Peter.

Ad septimam dicitur quod licet quantum ad multa sit
similitudo inter corpus Christi mysticum quod est
ecclesia et corpus materiale hominis, non tamen est
quantum ad omnia simile. Corpus enim hominis nec ad
tempus manet vivum sine capite; corpus autem Christi
mysticum absque capite in terris ad tempus vivum
manere potest. Sepe enim caret capite in terris, quamvis
tunc habeat caput in celis, scilicet Christum qui est
ecclesie caput, ut habetur ad Ephesios 1. Crebro enim
caret summo pontifice qui est caput ecclesie, nec tamen
tunc desinit esse spiritualiter viva, ymmo vivit vita
gracie. Debet tamen quando convenienter poterit sibi
constituere caput. Corpus igitur Christi mysticum potest
esse sine multis membris, quelibet enim ecclesia
particularis est membrum ecclesie. Unde ecclesie
Parisiensis, Lugdunensis, Lucenensis, Ianuensis sunt
membra ecclesie, et tamen sine istis posset esse corpus
Christi mysticum. Quamvis enim predicte ecclesie a
fide discederent, non propter hoc corpus Christi
mysticum deperiret. Et ideo quamvis Romana ecclesia
post papam sit principale membrum ecclesie, tamen
sine ipsa posset esse ecclesia.

It is said to the seventh that although there is a
likeness in many ways between the mystical body of
Christ which is the church and the material body of a
person, yet they are not alike in all ways. For without
a head the body of a person does not remain alive for
any time, but the mystical body of Christ can remain
alive for a time without a head on earth. For it often
lacks a head on earth, although then it does have a
head in heaven, namely Christ who is the head of the
church, as we find in Ephesians 1. For it frequently
does lack the highest pontiff who is the head of the
church, and yet then it does not fail to be alive
spiritually -- in fact it lives with the life of grace.
Nevertheless it should appoint a head for itself when
it can do so conveniently. The mystical body of
Christ can exist without many members, therefore,
because every particular church is a member of the
church. So, the churches of Paris, Lyons, Lucca and
Genoa are members of the church and yet the
mystical body of Christ could exist without them. For
even if those churches were to abandon the faith, the
mystical body of Christ would not on that account
perish. And therefore although the Roman church is
the main member of the church after the pope, there
could nevertheless be a church without it.

Ad octavam dicitur quod Romanam ecclesiam malicia
posset extinguere. Cum vero dicit Pelagius papa quod
nulla alia ecclesia nisi que in apostolica est radice

It is said to the eighth that evil could destroy the
Roman church. But when Pope Pelagius says that
there is no other church except that which is founded
