about a pope defamed of the crime of heresy. Therefore
since catholics have the power to inquire about a pope
defamed of the crime of idolatry, it follows that they
have the power to inquire about a pope defamed of the
crime of heresy.

obstinacy with error. And thus catholics must inquire
about a pope defamed of the crime of heresy.
