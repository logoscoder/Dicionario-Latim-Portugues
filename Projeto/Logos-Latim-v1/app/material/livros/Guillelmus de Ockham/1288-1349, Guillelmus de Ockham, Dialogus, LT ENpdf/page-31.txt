rogavit ne unquam deficeret; imo quicunque diceret
ecclesiam universalem errare in articulum fidei
sanctam ecclesiam catholicam vehementer impugnaret.
Ecclesia autem universalis multas praedicat veritates
quae nec in Scripturis Divinis habentur nec ex solis eis
possunt inferri, sicut per exempla priora patet. Ergo et
huiusmodi veritates firmiter sunt credendae.

He also prayed for Peter that his faith would never fail
[Luke 22:32]. Indeed anyone who was to say that the
universal church was in error with regard to an article
of faith would be violently attacking the holy catholic
church. However, the universal church preaches many
truths which are not found in the divine scriptures and
can not be inferred from them alone, as is clear from
the earlier examples. Therefore truths of this kind
should be firmly believed.

Quinta ratio est haec. Non minoris auctoritatis sunt
scripta summorum pontificum et sanctorum doctorum
quae pro sanis dogmatibus conscripserunt quam sint
quaecunque chronicae et historiae, sive infidelium sive
fidelium, quae extra Scripturam Sacram habentur; sed
omnino fatuus censeretur qui omnes cronicas et
historias extra canonem Bibliae reprobaret vel eas
diceret minime approbandas. Tunc enim liceret omnia
quae narrantur de summis pontificibus, imperatoribus,
regibus, regnis, et aliis quibuscunque quae non
inveniuntur in Biblia respuere et negare, quod
inconveniens est censendum. Ergo multo magis scriptis
summorum pontificum et sanctorum quae pro sanis
dogmatibus conscripserunt est firmiter inhaerendum; in
scriptis autem eorum plures veritates quae non
reperiuntur in Biblia inseruntur; ergo et tales veritates
sunt firmiter credende.

A fifth argument is this. The writings composed by
the highest pontiffs and holy doctors for the sake of
sound doctrine are not of less authority than are any
chronicles and histories, whether by unbelievers or
believers, which are found outside sacred scripture;
but a person who was to reject all the chronicles and
histories outside the bible or was to say that they
should not be approved would be considered
completely foolish. For then it would be permissible
to reject and deny everything which is narrated about
highest pontiffs, emperors, kings, kingdoms, and
anything else which is not found in the bible, and this
should be considered irrational. [See Significant
Variants, para. 2.] So much the more, therefore,
should we adhere firmly to the writings composed by
highest pontiffs and saints for sound doctrine;
however, many truths that are not found in the bible
are introduced into their writings; therefore, such
truths should also be firmly believed.

Discipulus Rationes et auctoritates quas pro secunda
sententia adduxisti fortes mihi videntur. Et quamvis
nolim quod in toto hoc opere manifestes quae est tua
assertio quando contraria recitas et adversa, unum
tamen in generali cupio scire, an scilicet quando illam
assertionem quae tua est rationibus et auctoritatibus
munire conaris, existimes omnes rationes et
auctoritates quas allegas conclusionem tuam
demonstrative probare.

Student The arguments and texts which you have
brought forward for the second opinion seem strong to
me. And although I do not want you to make clear
throughout this work what your own opinion is when
you record contrary and opposed matters, yet there is
one thing in general that I want to know and that is
whether, when you try to support with arguments and
texts that assertion which is your own, you think that
all the texts and arguments that you bring forward
prove your conclusion demonstratively.

Magister Pro sententia quam reputo veram motiva
quandoque demonstrativa, interdum probabilia tantum,
nonnunquam vero solummodo apparentia, propter alios
exercitandos aut probandos seu tentandos allego.

Master For the opinion that I regard as true I bring
forward reasons that are sometimes demonstrative,
sometimes only probable, sometimes indeed only
plausible, in order to exercise, test or try other people.

Discipulus Modus iste valde mihi placet quia per hoc
saepe scientiam inflatorum experiar. Porro, cum
quaesivi quibus veritatibus oporteat firmiter assentire,
super quo diversas sententias retulisti, quarum prima
habet convenienter dicere quod solummodo
scriptoribus sacrarum literarum fides firmissima est
adhibenda, secunda vero quae magis mihi placet
concedere debet quod etiam aliis est credendum, ideo
nunc interrogo quibus auctoriibus praeter scriptores

Student That way pleases me greatly because through
it I may often put the knowledge of the haughty to the
test. Next, since I sought to know which truths it is
necessary firmly to assent to, about which you have
reported different opinions, the first of which implies
that the firmest faith should be offered only to the
writers of the bible, and the second, which pleases me
more, allows that others should also be believed, [See
Significant Variants, para. 3.] I therefore now ask
