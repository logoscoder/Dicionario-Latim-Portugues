Master: The reply is that the confirming of
some election does not always pertain to
him to whom it ought to be placed before.
Hence it also seems to some people that at
this time the election of an emperor should
be placed before the supreme pontiff, yet it
ought by no means be confirmed by him.
The election of the supreme pontiff was
placed before the emperor, therefore, not so
that the emperor would confirm that
election but so that the emperor would
examine the election. When it was
examined the emperor would consent to
that election and command that all those
subject to him should hold the elect as true
pope and true supreme pontiff after he had
been ordained. Gratian seems to attest to
this when he says, in the oft-quoted dist. 63,
para. Principibus (col.326), "Indeed custom
and order have handed it down that on
account of the dissensions of schismatics
and heretics the elections of Roman pontiffs
and others bishops should be referred to
princes and emperors; because the church
of God has sometimes been shaken by these
people and put at risk, we read that it has
frequently been defended against them by
the laws of most faithful emperors. The
election of catholics was handed over to
princes, therefore, so that strengthened by
their authority no heretic or schismatic
would dare to oppose it, and so that those
princes would be in accord as most devout
sons with him whom they saw elected as
their father and would become his
supporters in everything." In the same way,
according to some people, the election of
the emperor is now placed before the pope,
not for the pope to confirm the election or
to confer the imperial dignity on him, since
he is a true emperor by virtue of the fact
that he has been elected, but so that no
cleric or other adherent of the pope who
strives for the destruction of the empire, of
whom we believe there is a very great
number in these times, dares to oppose the
election of an emperor strengthened by the
authority of the pope, and so that the pope
