ambicionem et simoniam et per vias alias multas
impias et iniquas; ergo talis per papatum in fide
nullatenus confirmatur.

wrongly to the papacy, namely out of ambition, by
simony or in many other wicked and wrong ways;
such a person, therefore, is not confirmed in faith by
the papacy.

Octava racio eorum est hec. Ille status per quem
assumens ipsum confirmatur in fide et in quo nullus
potest errare non est fugiendus a viris perfectis sed toto
desiderio appetendus, quia talis status vel est omnino
ab omni periculo spirituali securus vel est minus
periculosus statu in quo non est quis confirmatus in
fide, eo quod propter defectum fidei et imperfeccior sit
quis et ad peccandum proclivior; sed papatus non est
appetendus sed fugiendus, nec est minus periculosus
quam alii status in quibus contingit errare contra fidem;
propter quod et beatus Clemens recusavit fieri papa;
ergo per papatum nemo confirmatur in fide.

Their eighth argument is this. That state through
which the one assuming it is confirmed in faith and in
which no one can err should not be shunned by
perfect men but should be sought with all their desire,
because such a state either is completely safe from
any spiritual danger or is less dangerous than a state in
which no one is confirmed in faith, since on account
of a defect of faith someone is both more imperfect
and more inclined to sin; but the papacy should not be
sought but should be shunned and it is not less
dangerous than other states in which it is possible to
err against the faith; it is for this reason that blessed
Clement refused to become pope; therefore no one is
confirmed in faith by the papacy.

Nona racio est hec: ille qui contra fidem errare non
potest ad diffiniendum et determinandum dubia que
circa fidem emergunt non indiget aliorum
constitutorum in hac vita mortali pericia, sicut qui in
geometria vel alia facultate errare non posset ad
diffiniendum dubia in eadem aliorum consilio minime
indigeret. Sic eciam quia congregacio fidelium contra
fidem errare non potest aliorum quam Christianorum
sapienciam non requirit ad diffiniendum illa que sunt
consona catholice veritati. Sed papa ad multa dubia que
circa fidem emergunt catholicam declaranda et
diffinienda indiget aliorum pericia; aliter enim pro
dubiis declarandis et heresibus extirpandis frustra
fuissent generalia concilia congregata; frustra eciam
consuleret in sacra pagina eruditos. Ergo papa potest
contra fidem errare.

A ninth argument is this. That one who can not err
against faith does not need knowledge of the
constitutions of others in this mortal life in order to
define and determine doubts that emerge about faith,
just as he who was not able to err in geometry or some
other branch of study would not need the advice of
others in order to explain doubts in that branch. In the
same way too, because the congregation of the faithful
can not err against faith it does not need the wisdom
of others besides Christians to define those things that
are in harmony with catholic truth. But the pope does
need the knowledge of others in order to make clear
and explain the many doubts that emerge about
catholic faith. For otherwise general councils would
have been assembled in vain to make doubts clear and
to eradicate heresies. It would also be vain to consult
experts on the sacred page. Therefore, the pope can
err against faith.

Decima racio eorum est hec: omnis purus viator qui
potest actuale peccatum et mortale contra legem dei
committere potest hereticam incurrere pravitatem, quia
talis potest dampnabiliter excecari, cum, ut habetur
Sapien. 2, malicia peccatorum eosdem excecat de
impiis. Enim ibi scribitur, "Excecavit illos malicia
eorum." Et ita deduci in tantam poterunt cecitatem ut
catholicam abnegent veritatem. Sed papa potest actuale
et mortale peccatum committere, secundum quod
Bonifacius martyr, prout legitur dist. 40, c. Si papa, et
Simachus papa, ut habetur 9, q. 3, c. Aliorum testantur
aperte. Quod eciam ecclesia catholica insinuat
evidenter cum pro ipsius spirituali salute preces ad
Deum fundere non desistit. Ergo papa potest hereticam
incurrere pravitatem.

Their tenth argument is this. Every mere pilgrim who
can commit an actual mortal sin against the law of
God can incur heretical wickedness, because such a
person can be culpably blinded, since the malice of
sinners blinds them, as we find in Wisdom 2[:21]. For
it is written about the ungodly there, "For their own
malice blinded them." And so they could be led into
such great blindness that they deny catholic truth. But
the pope can commit an actual mortal sin according to
the clear testimony of the martyr Boniface, as we read
in dist. 40, c. Si papa [col.146], and Pope Symachus,
as we find in 9, q. 3, c. Aliorum [col.610]. The
catholic church manifestly implies this too when it
does not cease pouring out prayers to God for the
pope's [ipsius] spiritual salvation. Therefore the pope
can incur heretical wickedness.

Undecima racio eorum est hec: illi qui in exponendis

Their eleventh argument is this. Those who are to be
