condemnationem suam determinat et diffinit
assertiones quas reprobat esse et fuisse haereticas. Et
ita non facit novum articulum fidei sed noviter diffinit
aliquem articulum pertinere et pertinuisse ad
catholicam veritatem, et ita talis veritas, quamvis
noviter diffiniatur esse catholica, prius tamen fuit
catholica.

his condemnation he determines and defines
assertions that he condemns as being and having been
heretical. And so he does not make a new article of
faith but newly defines some article as pertaining and
having pertained to catholic truth, and so even if such
a truth is newly defined as catholic, it was
nevertheless catholic before.

Secunda ratio est hec. Si aliqua veritas est catholica
solummodo quia est a Romano pontifice approbata, aut
ergo est catholica quia est a Romano pontifice sive
explicite sive implicite approbata aut est tantummodo
catholica quia est a Romano pontifice explicite
approbata. Si detur primum sequitur quod pontifex
Romanus non potest facere novum articulum fidei de
aliqua veritate quae antea necessaria existebat quia
omnes veritates divinitus revelatae, in Scripturis Sacris
insertae et quas unversalis ecclesia recipit et quae
sequuntur ex aliqua vel aliquibus praedictarum fuerunt
antea explicte vel implicite per Romanos pontifices
approbatae. Ipsi enim totam fidem ecclesiae
approbaverunt
et
per
consequens
implicite
approbaverunt omnia quae sequuntur quia, sicut qui
unum dicit dicit omnia quae sequuntur ex illo, ita qui
unum approbat approbat omnia quae sequuntur ex illo.
Si detur secundum, scilicet quod ideo aliqua veritas
solummodo dicitur catholica quia est a Romano
pontifice explicite approbata, ergo tales veritates
"Christus mortuos suscitavit", "Christus fuit Deus et
homo", "Deus omnia praescit", et huiusmodi non
essent catholicae reputandae nisi essent a Romano
pontifice explicite approbatae, quod pro inconvenienti
videtur habendum.

[B] A second argument is this. If some truth is
catholic only because it has been approved by the
Roman pontiff, it is as a result catholic [Bi] either
because it has been approved either explicitly or
implicitly by the Roman pontiff or [Bii] it is catholic
only because it has been approved explicitly by the
Roman pontiff. [Bi] If the first is granted, it follows
that the Roman pontiff can not make a new article of
faith from any truth that was necessary beforehand,
because all truths divinely revealed, inserted in the
sacred scriptures, accepted by the universal church
and following from some one or some of those have
been explicitly or implicitly approved earlier by
Roman pontiffs. For they have approved the whole
faith of the church and, as a consequence, have
approved implicitly everything which follows [from
it], because just as he who says one thing says
everything which follows from it, so he who approves
one thing approves everything which follows from it.
[Bii] If the second is granted, however, namely that
some truth is said to be catholic only because it has
been explicitly approved by a Roman pontiff, such
truths as "Christ raised the dead", "Christ was God
and man", "God foreknows everything", and the like
should not have been regarded as catholic unless they
had been explicitly approved by a Roman pontiff, and
it seems that this should be considered irrational.

Per istas itaque rationes ostenditur quod summus
pontifex non potest facere novum articulum fidei nec
de veritate non catholica potest facere catholicam. Ex
quo concludunt isti quod Romanus pontifex de
assertione non haeretica non potest facere haereticam
quia omni assertioni catholicae contradicit assertio
haeretica et econverso quia, sicut si una
contradictoriarum est vera altera est falsa et econverso,
ita si una contradictoriarum est catholica altera est
haeretica; sed sicut probatum est Romanus pontifex
non potest de veritate non catholica facere catholicam,
ergo nec de assertione non haeretica potest facere
haereticam.

And so it is shown by these arguments that the highest
pontiff can not make a new article of faith and can not
make catholic a truth that is not catholic. They
conclude from this that a Roman pontiff can not make
heretical an assertion that is not heretical because an
heretical assertion contradicts every catholic assertion,
and vice versa, because just as if one of [two]
contradictories is true the other is false, and vice
versa, so if one of [two] contradictories is catholic the
other is heretical. But just as it has been proved that a
Roman pontiff can not make catholic a truth that is not
catholic, nor can he, therefore, make heretical an
assertion that is not heretical.

Tertia ratio est ista. Si ideo solummodo aliqua assertio
est inter haereses computanda quia est a Romano
pontifice vel etiam ab ecclesia condemnata, aut ergo
quia damnata sive implicite sive explicite aut solum
quia damnata explicite. Si detur primum, sequitur quod
omnis assertio quae potest licite damnari est modo
haeresis, quia omnis talis est iam per ecclesiam et

[C] A third argument is this. If an assertion is
reckoned among the heresies only because it has been
condemned by a Roman pontiff or also by the church,
this is therefore [Ci] because it has been condemned
either implicitly or explicitly or [Cii] only because it
has been condemned explicitly. [Ci] If the first is
granted it follows that every assertion which can
