excellentes. Quare si ad canonistas principaliter
pertineret inter veritates catholicas et haereses iudicare
ipsi de non damnando haereses inter theologos
dogmatizatas modo praedicto excusari nequirent. Sed
nunquid si fuissent magistri in theologia excusari
valerent?

outstanding in theology. If it were chiefly to pertain to
canonists, therefore, to judge between catholic and
heretical truths they would not be able to be excused
in the aforesaid way for not condemning heresies
taught among theologians as doctrine. But would they
have been able to be excused if they had been masters
in theology?

Magister Dicunt isti quod sic, quia multi, ut asserunt,
sunt in theologia doctoris nomen habentes per favores
humanos et procurationes indebitas ac ambitiones
diabolicas ad magisterium exaltati qui sacrarum
litterarum sunt penitus imperiti.

Master They say 'yes', because there are many
people, they affirm, who have the name of doctor in
theology who have been raised to the position of
master through human favours, undue patronage and
devilish ambitions and who are wholly ignorant of
sacred letters.

Capitulum 31

Chapter 31

Can, and must, the pope follow expert advice in condemning doctrine as heresy?
Discipulus Licet summi pontifices Scripturae Sacrae
notitiam non habuerint excellentem, tamen per hoc non
videntur aliqualiter excusandi quia poterant doctos
consulere et peritos. Qui autem potest habere copiam
peritorum non potest per ignorantiam excusari. Talis
ergo ignorantia Scripturae Divinae eos nequaquam
excusat, nisi forte dicatur quod, quia in theologia et in
philosophia antequam ad papatum essent assumpti
nequaquam exercitati fuerunt, non poterant ad
intelligendum tam subtiles difficultates theologiae
etiam per informationem peritorum attingere. Sed et
hoc sufficere non videtur, quia quamvis non potuissent
intelligere informationes circa huiusmodi debebant
tamen credere informationibus aliorum, ut apparet, et
per consequens iuxta informationem peritorum,
quamvis eas per intellectum non caperent, ad
condemnationem haeresum procedere debuerunt. Unde
et de hoc ultimo, an scilicet si summus pontifex
Sacrarum Scripturarum ignarus aliquam haeresim
promulgatam, quamvis videre nequeat quomodo
catholicae veritati adversatur, de consilio peritorum
debeat condemnare quid teneant homines manifesta.

Student Even if the highest pontiffs did not have
excellent knowledge of sacred scripture, it does not
seem nevertheless that they should in any way be
excused because of this since they could have
consulted the learned and the experts. He who can
have access to experts, however, can not be excused
through ignorance. Such ignorance of divine scripture
does not excuse them, therefore, unless it is said
perhaps that because they had not been trained in
theology and philosophy before they had been raised
to the papacy they could not attain an understanding
of such subtle theological difficulties even with the
instruction of experts. But this also does not seem
adequate, because even if they had not been able to
understand instruction about these things they should
nevertheless have believed the instruction of others, it
seems, and consequently they should have proceeded
in accordance with the instruction of experts to
condemn the heresies even if they did not understand
them. Would you therefore make clear what people
hold about this last issue, that is whether a highest
pontiff ignorant of the sacred scriptures should on the
advice of experts condemn some heresy that has been
promulgated even if he can not see how it is opposed
to catholic truth?

Magister Quidam dicunt quod summus pontifex in hoc
casu debet credere eruditis in Scriptura Sacra et iuxta
eorum consilium, quamvis non videat quomodo
haeresis
dogmatizata
veritati
repugnat,
ad
damnationem eiusdem procedere. Alii vero astruunt
manifeste quod a quibuscunque et quotcumque papae
dicatur aliquam assertionem haereticam esse
censendam ipse ad damnationem solemnem eiusdem
nullo modo debet procedere nisi ipsemet aperte
consideret vel divina inspiratione vel propria
meditatione vel librorum inspectione aut aliorum
informatione vel aliquo alio modo quod talis assertio

Master Some say that in this case a highest pontiff
ought to believe those who are learned in sacred
scripture and in accord with their advice to proceed to
the condemnation of a heresy even if he does not see
how the heresy that has been taught as doctrine is
opposed to the truth. Others, however, argue openly
that by whomever and however often it is said to a
pope that some assertion should be considered
heretical he should in no way proceed to a solemn
condemnation of it unless he himself clearly sees,
through divine inspiration, his own meditation, the
reading of books, the instruction of others or some
