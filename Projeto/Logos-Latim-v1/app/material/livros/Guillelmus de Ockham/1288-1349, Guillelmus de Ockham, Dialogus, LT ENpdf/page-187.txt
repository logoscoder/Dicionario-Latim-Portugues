contra legem erraverunt; iudices eciam Hebreorum
nonnulli post Iosue contra legem egerunt, et omnes
reges preter David, Ezechiam et Iosiam idolatriam
commiserunt. Quare et summi sacerdotes et iudices
supremi in veteri lege contra legem potuerunt iubere, in
quo casu non erat obediendum eisdem. Et consimiliter
est de summo pontifice senciendum quod errare potest
contra legem divinam; si tamen non erraverit eius est
standum sentencie.

erected an altar against the law, as we find in 4 Kings
16. The highest priests in the time of Christ also erred
against the law in many ways. Some of the judges of
the Hebrews after Joshua also acted against the law
and all the kings except for David, Hezechiah and
Josiah committed idolatry. So even the highest priests
and supreme judges under the old law could make an
order against the law and in that case they should not
have been obeyed. And similarly we should deem that
the highest pontiff can err against divine law. Yet if he
does not err we should abide by his judgement.

Ad quintam racionem respondetur quod papatus
officium non necessario confert suscipienti innocencie
sanctitatem. Plures enim summi pontifices in officio
existentes flagicia enormia commiserunt. Beatus enim
Marcellinus idolatravit. Anastasius secundus heresim et
fautoriam hereticorum incurrit. Stephanus 6 Formosum
papam defunctum inique persequebatur omnes
ordinaciones eius irritas decernendo. Qui eciam corpus
Formosi, in concilio positum et papali veste exutum,
laicali habitu indui et, duobus digitis dextere eius
abscisis manus eius in Tiberim iactari precepit. Sergius
4 Formosum papam de sepulchro extractum et in sede
pontificali sacerdotaliter indutum impie decollari
precepit et in Tiberim iactari et omnes per Formosum
papam ordinatos inique deordinavit. Iohannes 12
venator et lubricus feminas publice tenuit; Iohanni
Diacono Cardinali nasum et cuidam subdiacono
manum amputari precepit; tandem extitit papatu
privatus. Benedictus 7 depredata primum ecclesia
sancti Petri Iohanni diacono cardinali oculos eruit.
Sylvester 2 demones in papatu consuluit. Liquet igitur
quod papatus non confert innocencie sanctitatem.

The reply to the fifth argument is that the office of the
papacy does not necessarily confer the sanctity of
innocence on the one receiving it. For many highest
pontiffs committed enormous crimes while they were
in office. For blessed Marcellin committed idolatry.
Anastasius II fell into heresy and the supporting of
heretics. Stephen VI wickedly persecuted Pope
Formosus when he was dead by pronouncing that all
his decrees were invalid. He even ordered that the
body of Formosus, laid out in council and stripped of
its papal vestments, be dressed in lay clothing and that
his hands be cast into the Tiber after two fingers of his
right hand were cut off. Sergius IV ordered that Pope
Formosus be dragged out of his tomb, dressed in
priestly garb in the pontifical see, impiously
decapitated and cast into the Tiber, and he wickedly
defrocked all those who had been ordained by him.
John XII was a hunter and was lewd, publicly
embracing women. He ordered that the nose of John, a
cardinal deacon, and the hand of a certain sub-deacon
be cut off. He was at length deprived of the papacy.
Benedict VII tore out the eyes of the cardinal deacon
John after he had first plundered the church of St.
Peter. Sylvester II consulted demons while he was
pope. It is clear, therefore, that the papacy does not
confer the sanctity of innocence. [Cf. Nicolas
Minorita: Chronica (ed. GÃ¡l and Flood, St
Bonaventure, 1996), pp. 953-4.]

Ad decretum autem Symachi respondetur quod
nequaquam Symachus papa intendit astruere quod
nemo potest esse papa nisi sanctus, cum constet multos
sceleratissimos viros fuisse in summo pontificio
residentes, sed vult asserere Symachus papa quod ad
papatus sublimatus officium presumendus est esse
sanctus, eciam licet prius fuisset malus, nisi contrarium
evidenter appareat, et ideo non dicit 'ipsum esse
sanctum' sed 'quis sanctum esse dubitet', quasi diceret
nemo debet dubitare male suspicando sed presumere
quod assumptus ad papatum sit sanctus, nisi contrarium
constiterit evidenter. Et sic exponit glossa ibidem
dicens, "Et si quandoque forte apostolici non essent
boni, semper presumuntur esse boni;" et obiiciens in
contrarium ait, "Nonne est contrarium 19, dist.
Anastasius et 21, dist. Nunc autem?" Ad quam
obieccionem respondens ait, Sed non dicitur hic quod

The reply to the decree of Symachus, however, is that
Pope Symachus did not intend to argue that no one
can be pope unless he is holy, since it is certain that
many very wicked men have remained in the highest
pontificate, but Pope Symachus wants to affirm that it
should be presumed of someone raised to the office of
the papacy that he is holy, even if he had been bad
before, unless the contrary is clearly apparent. And so
he does not say that 'he is holy' but 'who will doubt
that he is holy?', as if to say that no one should doubt
him by making evil conjectures but should presume
that someone raised to the papacy is holy, unless the
contrary is clearly the case. This is how the gloss on
this point expounds it. It says [s. v. quis enim,
col.193], "And if sometimes popes were perhaps not
good, they are always presumed to be good;" and
arguing to the contrary it says, "Are not dist. 19,
