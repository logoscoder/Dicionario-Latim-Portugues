7. For example, in OP, vol. 1, 3.353, 3.534, 4.279; vol. 4, CE 1.131, Brev., i.3.30.
8. Any reader who can use the edition could of course understand an apparatus in Latin.
However, the editors do not wish to pretend to a capacity to write Latin. Readers whose
language is not English will understand "added", "omitted", etc., if they would have
understood "add.", "om.", etc. "Gap" is the only English word they will need to learn.
9. Offler does not give a lemma if it is clear what word is in question (see OP, vol. 1, p. 296,
OND 1.110). The program "Critical Edition Typesetter" automatically generates a lemma for
every variant.
10. For additions Offler includes the next word of text after the addition (see OP, vol. 1, p.
295, OND 1.68 - "ab" is the word added).
11. Offler sometimes puts the siglum for a supporting witness before the colon separating
lemma from variant. See OP, vol. 4, p. 15, CE Prol. 31, "noluerit".
12. Offler italicises the title and uses small roman numerals to indicate the book, e.g. "Brev.
ii.5.7".
13. Offler's refers to the tracts of part 3 as "IusIIIae Dial." and "IIusIIIae Dial."
14. Offler repeats in his footnotes references to the Decretum in the style used in Friedberg's
"Index canonum", i.e in the order: c., di., or c., C., q. For the Decretales he gives numbers, as
in Friedberg's "Tabula capitulorum", but whereas Friedberg separates the numbers by full
stops Offler uses commas ("II,23,4"). For both he gives the column reference to Friedberg's
edition. See for example OP, vol. IV, p. 103, notes to Brev. 1.5.7-8. The modern system of
citation (of which Offler's is a variant) seems to have been invented during the nineteenth
century. Ability to use the system Ockham followed (explained for example in Modus legendi
abbreviaturas in utroque iure, with many reprints into the 16th century - see British Museum
Catalogue) will be necessary to any reader who wishes to pursue Ockham's use of the canon
law, since this will require use of the Gloss, which uses the medieval citation system. It
therefore does not seem unreasonable to ask readers to become familiar with that system
(especially since they can simply use the Friedberg column references).
15. Offler sometimes uses superscripts and italics. See OP, vol. IV, p. 13
