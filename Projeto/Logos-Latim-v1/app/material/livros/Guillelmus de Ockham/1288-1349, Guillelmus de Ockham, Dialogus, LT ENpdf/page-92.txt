atque perversam nulla pertinaci animositate defendat;
secundo quod talem sententiam non audacia suae
praesumptionis invenerit sed a seductis parentibus
atque in errorem lapsis acceperit; tertio quod quaerat
cauta sollicitudine veritatem; quarto quod paratus sit
corrigi si invenerit. Cuicunque ergo defecerit aliquod
quattuor est inter haereticos computandus. Quamvis
igitur quis non sit pertinax, si tamen audacia suae
praesumptionis aliquam falsam et perversam
sententiam invenerit vel non quaerat cauta sollicitudine
veritatem aut non sit paratus corrigi cum invenerit, est
inter haereticos computandus iuxta sententiam
Augustini.

defend his false and evil opinion with pertinacious ill
will; secondly, that he has not discovered such an
opinion from the boldness of his own presumption but
has received it from his parents led astray and fallen
into error; thirdly, that he seek the truth with careful
diligence; fourthly, that he be ready to be corrected if
he finds it. Anyone in whom any of those four is
lacking, therefore, should be counted among the
heretics. Therefore, even if someone is not
pertinacious, nevertheless if he has discovered some
false and evil opinion from the boldness of his own
presumption or does not seek the truth with careful
diligence or is not ready to be corrected when he finds
it, he should, according to Augustine's opinion, be
counted among the heretics.

Magister Ad istam obiectionem faciliter respondetur.
Ad cuius evidentiam dicunt isti esse sciendum quod
inter dubitantem et errantem pertinaciter et inter
errorem pertinaciter defendentem differentia invenitur,
quia multi haeretici dubitant vel errant pertinaciter, eo
quod intus in mente in sua dubitatione vel errore
persistunt pertinaciter, qui tamen errorem suum vel
dubitationem neque pertinaciter neque alio modo
defendunt, imo aliquando timore vel ambitione aut
cupiditate vel ex alia causa negant exterius quod in
mente irrevocabiliter tenent. Multi etiam econverso
falsam sententiam atque perversam exterius pertinaci
animositate defendunt vel defendere possunt cui tamen
nec pertinaciter nec alio modo in corde adhaerent. Nam
contingit aliquando scienter defendere falsum,
quemadmodum saepe falsi et pessimi advocati
cupiditate ducti scienter falsas causas et iniquas
pertinacissima animositate defendunt. Et ita non omnis
pertinaciter dubitans vel errans falsam sententiam
pertinaci animositate defendit nec econverso.

Master That objection is easily replied to. To make it
clear they say that it should be known that we find a
difference between doubting and erring pertinaciously
and defending an error pertinaciously, because there
are many heretics who doubt or err pertinaciously, in
that internally in their own mind they persist
pertinaciously in their doubt or error, yet who do not
defend their error or doubt pertinaciously or in any
other way; indeed sometimes out of fear, ambition,
greed or for some other reason they deny outwardly
what they hold irrevocably in their mind. On the other
hand many people defend or can defend outwardly
and and with pertinacious ill will a false and evil
opinion to which nevertheless they do not cling in
their heart either pertinaciously or in any other way.
For it is possible sometimes knowingly to defend a
falsity, just as false and wicked advocates drawn by
greed often knowingly defend false and unjust causes
with the most pertinacious ill will. And so not
everyone doubting or erring pertinaciously defends a
false opinion with pertinacious ill will, nor vice versa.

Discipulus Hoc quod nunc declaratum est probabile
puto, et ideo ad propositum applica. Dimittamus tamen
loqui de dubitante, de errante solummodo loquendo,
quia forte dicunt isti quod illa quae de errante dicuntur
etiam de dubitante debent intelligi, pro eo quod
dubitantes de fide, sicut errantes contra fidem, inter
haereticos computantur vel ab haereticorum numero
non excluduntur.

Student I think that what you have now made clear is
probable, and so would you apply it to the present
case. Let us give up speaking about doubting,
however, speaking only about erring, because perhaps
they say that those things that are said about erring
should also be understood about doubting because of
the fact that those doubting the faith, like those erring
against the faith, are counted among the heretics or are
not excluded from the number of the heretics.

Magister Sicut tibi placet solummodo de errante
faciam mentionem, et qualiter saepe dicto modo
describentes haereticum ad obiectionem tuam per
praemissum notabile quod tu approbare videris
respondeant declarabo. Dicunt itaque quod beatus
Augustinus quatuor conditiones enumerat quae
requiruntur ad hoc quod aliquis tenens falsam
sententiam atque perversam contra catholicam
veritatem non sit per ecclesiam inter haereticos

Master Just as you please, I will mention only
someone who errs, and I will make clear how those
describing heresy in the oft-mentioned way reply to
your objection by means of the notable point just
made which you seem to approve. And so they say
that blessed Augustine enumerates four conditions
that are required so that someone holding a false and
evil opinion against catholic truth is not to be counted
by the church as among the heretics, meaning that
