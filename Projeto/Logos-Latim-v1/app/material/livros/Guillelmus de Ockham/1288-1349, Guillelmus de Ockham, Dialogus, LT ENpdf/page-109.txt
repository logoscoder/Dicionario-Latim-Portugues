quis pertinaciter corde adhaeret haereticae pravitati
vel pertinaciter dubitat de catholica veritate. Alia est
pertinacia exterior quae facto vel verbo exteriori
consistit. Prima pertinacia aliter quam per
praesumptionem probabilem vel violentam convinci
non potest a nobis quia in talibus non necessario
interioribus exteriora respondent, imo unum saepe
tenetur interius et aliud exterius similatur.

when someone pertinaciously clings in his heart to
heretical wickedness or pertinaciously doubts catholic
truth. The other is exterior pertinacity which consists in
an outward deed or a word.We can not convict anyone
of the first form of pertinacity except by a probable or a
violent presumption, because in such cases what is on
the outside does not necessarily correspond to what is
within; indeed, often one thing is held within and
another thing counterfeited on the outside.

Discipulus Quamvis intentio mea fuerit interrogare
de pertinacia exteriori solummodo, causa tamen
exercitii dicas aliqua de pertinacia interiori et
mentali, quis videlicet pertinaciter errat in mente?

Disciple Although my intention was to question you
only about exterior pertinacity, yet as an exercise [causa
exercitii] would you say something about interior and
mental pertinacity; who, that is to say, errs
pertinaciously in his mind?

Mental pertinacity
Magister Sunt quidam dicentes quod tripliciter
potest quis errare pertinaciter in mente. Primo
quidem si quis non obstantibus miraculis quae
audivit fuisse facta pro fide confirmanda putat fidem
esse falsam vel incertam. Secundo, si in genere
credit totam fidem esse veram, alicui tamen errori in
speciali, quem nescit explicite ad fidem pertinere,
adhaeret tam fortiter quod quantumcunque sibi
evidenter ostenderetur pertinere ad fidem, dictum
errorem nullo modo dimitteret sed ante putaret fidem
esse falsam. Sicut si in Veteri Testamento quando
fideles credere trinitatem personarum cum unitate
divinitatis explicite minime tenebantur, aliquis
credens totam doctrinam Moysi et fidelium esse
veram in speciali putasset quod tres personae non
sunt unus Deus et suo errori tam fortiter adhaesisset
quod ante doctrinam Moysi et prophetarum
credidisset esse falsam quam tenuisset tres personas
esse unum Deum. Iste licet in genere credidisset
totam fidem Moysi et prophetarum esse veram,
pertinax extitisset. Tertio, potest quis esse mentaliter
pertinax in errore si alicui errori adhaeret et negligit
quando et quomodo debet quaerere veritatem, quia
talis non est paratus corrigi sed persistit in errore
quem debet de necessitate salutis dimittere.

Master Some people say that there are three ways
someone can err pertinaciously in his mind. The first is
if, for example, notwithstanding the miracles that he has
heard have been done to confirm the faith, someone
thinks that the faith is false or uncertain. The second is if
in general he believes that the whole faith is true yet he
adheres so strongly to some particular error, which he
does not know pertains explicitly to the faith, that no
matter how clearly it were shown to him that the said
error does pertain to the faith he would in no way put it
aside but would sooner think that the faith is false. It is
just as if, when the faithful in the Old Testament were
not bound to believe explicitly in a trinity of persons
together with a unity of divinity, someone believing that
the whole teaching of Moses and the faithful is true had
thought in particular that three persons are not one God
and had clung so strongly to his error that he would have
believed the teaching of Moses and the prophets to be
false before he would have held that three persons are
one God. Although he would have believed in general
that the whole faith of Moses and the prophets is true, he
would have been pertinacious.Thirdly, someone can be
mentally pertinacious in error if he clings to some error
and neglects when and how he ought to seek the truth,
because such a person is not ready to be corrected but
persists in an error which he ought to put aside from
necessity of salvation.

Discipulus Inter negligentiam et pertinaciam
differentia reperitur. Sed iste ultimus est negligens.
Ergo non est pertinax.

Disciple A difference is found between negligence and
pertinacity; but that last-mentioned person is negligent;
therefore he is not pertinacious.

Magister Respondetur quod quamvis negligentia et
pertinacia distinguantur, tamen aliquis est negligens
etiam pertinax, nec est inconveniens quod aliqua
negligentia sit pertinacia reputanda.

Master It is replied that although negligence and
pertinacity are distinguished, someone negligent is
nevertheless also pertinacious and it is not inappropriate
that some negligence should be considered to be
pertinacity.
