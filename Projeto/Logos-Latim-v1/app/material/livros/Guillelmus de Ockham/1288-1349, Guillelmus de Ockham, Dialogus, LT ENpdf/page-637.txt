alienating things of this kind illicitly and
from an evil cause he would nevertheless
not be bound to make restitution to the
empire or to another person. He is also lord
of some immoveable things in this way, as
a result of which he can in the same way
give and alienate some castles and fields,
vines and cities. So in such things he has a
very full lordship and right. He does not
have such a full lordship and right,
however, in some immoveable things
because he can not sell, present, bequeath
or alienate them, just as he can not alienate
the empire and kingdoms the alienation of
which would redound to the notable
detriment of the empire, and if he were in
fact to alienate them, such an alienation
would not hold in law but everything
should be resumed into the right of the
empire and he himself would be bound to
make restitution if he could. He is lord of
such things to a certain extent, however, in
so far as he can appropriate and defend
them and use them for the common benefit;
and no one else is known to have any right
in them. He also has lordship of things
pertaining to others in so far as he can
remove them from them for a reason, for
the common benefit and because of an
offence by those possessing them and can
appropriate them for himself or can present
them to others. Yet because he can not do
this according to his own free will but
because of a fault by their possessors or for
a reason, namely for the common benefit,
he therefore does not have as full a lordship
and right in them as in the first things
which he can alienate at his own pleasure
just as he wishes, with the result that
however he has alienated them the
alienation holds, at least if he has conferred
them on those who are obedient and ought
not be recalled by anyone.
