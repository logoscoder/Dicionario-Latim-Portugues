pravitatis fermento negligentes fuerint vel remissi; ille
ergo ad quem spectat ex officio sibi iniuncto haereses
exstirpare si negligens fuerit vel remissus de damnabili
remissione vel negligentia excusari non potest; sed ad
summum pontificem spectat totam ecclesiam de
haeresibus non solum iam damnatis explicite sed etiam
aliis quibuscunque purgare; ergo qui tales haereses

negligent or remiss about purging their dioceses of the
leaven of heretical wickedness should be deposed; if
therefore he to whom it pertains in accordance with
the office with which he is charged to root out
heresies has been negligent or remiss, he can not be
excused from culpable negligence or laxness; but it
pertains to the highest pontiff to purge the whole
church of heresies, not only those already explicitly
condemned but also any others at all; those who have
supported the holding or teaching of such heresies,
therefore, have sinned culpably.

Discipulus Non videtur quod papa teneatur de novis
haeresibus quae non sunt damnatae explicite purgare
ecclesiam; sed sufficit sibi quod eam purget vel
purgatam conservet ab omni pravitate haeretica
explicite iam damnata.

Student It does not seem that the pope is bound to
purge the church of new heresies that have not been
condemned explicitly, but it is enough for him to
purge it or keep it purged of every heretical
wickedness already condemned explicitly.

Magister Hoc improbant isti, dicentes quod papa qui
haereses insurgentes de novo negligit improbare et
damnare apostolos et sanctos patres qui haereses
pullulantes celerrime damnaverunt nullatenus imitatur,
quorum tamen vestigiis inhaerere oportet Romanum
pontificem si eis vult in coelesti patria aggregari.
Peccaverunt ergo summi pontifices qui damnare
huiusmodi haereses neglexerunt.

Master They reject this, saying that a pope who
neglects to oppose and condemn heresies which newly
rise up is not imitating the apostles and holy fathers
who very swiftly condemned heresies as they came
forth. Yet it is necessary for the Roman pontiff to
cleave to their footsteps if he wants to join them in the
heavenly homeland. Highest pontiffs who have
neglected to condemn heresies of this kind, therefore,
have sinned.

Discipulus Apostoli et sancti patres ideo haereses
damnaverunt quia invenerunt pertinaces huiusmodi
haeresum assertores. Cum ergo theologi haeresum quas
putant veritati catholicae minime obviare pertinaces
non fuerunt assertores, non fuerunt haereses quas
opinando solummodo docuerunt per Romanos
pontifices condemnandae.

Student The apostles and holy fathers condemned
heresies because they found pertinacious assertors of
heresies of this kind. Therefore since theologians have
not been pertinacious assertors of heresies which they
think are not opposed to catholic truth, the heresies
which they have taught only as an opinion should not
be condemned by Roman pontiffs.

Magister Istam excusationem Romanorum pontificum
isti dupliciter impugnare. Primo quia nescierunt an
theologi suis opinionibus haereticalibus pertinaciter
adhaererent ex quo de hoc nullam inquisitionem
omnino fecerunt; ergo in inquirendo veritatem ut
periculis fidei obviarent negligentes vel remissi
fuerunt. Secundo sic: maiori periculo est fortius ac
diligentius et celerius obviandum; sed ex haeresibus
publice opinatis et dogmatizatis maius imminet
periculum
religioni
christianae
quam
ex
consuetudinibus onerosis et pravis quia, esto quod
dogmatizantes suis opinionibus minime pertinaciter
adhaererent, tamen timendum est ne simplices discipuli
audientes assertiones huiusmodi a magnis doctoribus
edoceri et pro eis fortiter allegari et a catholicis
nullatenus condemnari ex apparentia rationum quas
nesciunt solvere in adhaesionem pertinacem eisdem
haeresibus inducantur, et ne errores pestiferi pro
veritatibus catholicis incipiant venerari et pertinaciter
defensari; sed consuetudines onerosae et pravae sunt
celerrime comprimendae ne in privilegiorum ius ab

Master They try to attack in two ways that excuse for
the Roman pontiffs. Firstly, because the latter have
not known whether theologians would cling
pertinaciously to their heretical opinions because they
have not made any inquiry about this at all; they have
been negligent or remiss, therefore, in inquiring about
the truth in order to resist dangers to the church. The
second is as follows: a greater danger should be
resisted more strongly, diligently and swiftly; but a
greater danger threatens the christian religion from
heresies held publicly as an opinion and propounded
than from burdensome and evil customs because, even
if those propounding their opinions were not to adhere
to them pertinaciously, it should nevertheless be
feared lest simple students hearing assertions of this
kind taught by great doctors and argued for strongly
and not condemned by catholics be induced by the
plausibility of arguments they do not know how to
refute to a pertinacious adherence to those heresies,
and lest pestiferous errors begin to be venerated and
defended pertinaciously as catholic truths; but
