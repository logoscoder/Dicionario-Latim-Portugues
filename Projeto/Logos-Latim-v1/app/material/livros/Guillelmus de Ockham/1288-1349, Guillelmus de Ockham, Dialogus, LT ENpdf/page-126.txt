computatur; sed negans catholicam veritatem quam
prius catholicam reputavit est apostata a catholica
veritate, quia talis abicit catholicam veritatem; ergo est
inter pertinaces et hereticos computandus.

because he is an apostate from the faith and an
apostate from the faith is reckoned among the
heretics; but he who denies a catholic truth which he
had previously regarded as catholic is an apostate
from catholic truth because he casts aside catholic
truth; he should be reckoned, therefore, among the
pertinacious and the heretics.

Tertio sic: christianus infidelis inter pertinaces et
haereticos computatur; sed christianus qui negat
catholicam veritatem quam prius reputavit catholicam
est infidelis; ergo est pertinax et haereticus iudicandus.
Maior videtur certa. Minor probatur, quia qui negat
catholicam veritatem quam prius agnovit esse
catholicam est peior infideli qui nunquam novit
catholicam veritatem, teste Innocentio 3, qui, ut habetur
Extra, De apostatis, c. Quidam, ait, "Cum minus
malum existat viam Domini non agnoscere quam post
agnitam retroire." Hinc beatus Petrus canonica sua 2 c.
2 ait, "Melius enim erat eis non cognoscere viam
iustitiae quam post agnitionem retrorsum converti."
Veritas autem catholica est via iustitiae. Ergo maius
malum est post agnitam catholicam veritatem retroire
quam nunquam veritatem catholicam agnovisse. Sed
hoc non est maius malum nisi ratione deterioris
infidelitatis. Ergo qui negat veritatem catholicam quam
prius novit esse catholicam est infidelis et per
consequens pertinax et haereticus est censendus.

[It is proved] thirdly as follows. A faithless christian
is reckoned among the pertinacious and the heretics;
but a christian who denies a catholic truth that he had
previously regarded as catholic is faithless; he should
be judged, therefore, as pertinacious and a heretic.
The major [premise] seems certain. The minor is
proved: he who denies a catholic truth which he
previously knew to be catholic is worse than a
faithless person who has never known catholic truth -Innocent III testifies to this when he says, as we find
in Extra, De apostatis, c. Quidam [col. 791], "It is a
lesser evil not to know the way of the Lord than to
turn back after it has been known." Hence blessed
Peter says in the second chapter of his second letter [2
Peter 2:21]: "For it had been better for them not to
have known the way of justice, than after they have
known it to turn back." Now catholic truth is the way
of justice and so it is a greater evil to go back after
having known catholic truth than never to have
known it. But this is only a greater evil by reason of
worse faithlessness. He who denies a catholic truth
that he previously knew to be catholic, therefore, is
faithless and as a consequence should be considered
pertinacious and a heretic.

Discipulus Videtur quod istae rationes non concludunt,
tum quia potest quis negare veritatem catholicam quam
prius putavit catholicam quamvis non agnoverit eam
esse catholicam -- rationes autem praedictae videntur
procedere de eo qui negat veritatem catholicam quam
non solum putavit sed etiam agnovit esse catholicam -tum quia talis potest esse paratus corrigi, immo potest
se offerre paratum corrigi. Ergo licet erret non est inter
haereticos computandus.

Disciple Those arguments do not seem to be
conclusive. First, because someone can deny a
catholic truth that he previously thought to be
catholic, although he did not know that it is catholic;
the foregoing arguments, however, seem to be valid
about someone who denies a catholic truth which he
not only thought but also knew to be catholic.
Second, because such a person can be ready to be
corrected, or rather he can present himself as ready to
be corrected; although he errs, therefore, he should
not be reckoned among the heretics.

Magister Istae duae instantiae per idem videntur
excludi, per hoc scilicet quod non est tali in hoc casu
credendum, sive dicat quod licet prius putaverit non
tamen agnovit veritatem quam modo negat esse
catholicam, sive dicat se paratum corrigi. Quod enim in
primo dicto non sit sibi credendum ostenditur quia qui
invenitur sibi ipsi contrarius non est credendum, saltem
secundo dicto ipsius, teste Innocentio 3, qui, ut habetur
Extra, De probationibus, c. Per tuas, ait, "Cum nimis
indignum sit iuxta legitimas sanctiones ut, quod sua
quisque voce dilucide protestatus est, in eundem casum
proprio valeat testimonio infirmare." Et glossa Extra,

Master Those two objections both seem to be
excluded by the fact that in this situation such a
person should not be believed, either when he says
that even though he previously thought the truth that
he now denies is catholic yet he did not know this, or
when he says that he is ready to be corrected. That he
should not be believed in saying the first of these is
shown because he who is found to contradict himself
should not be believed, at least with respect to the
second thing he says. Innocent III testifies to this
when he says, as we find in Extra, De probationibus,
c. Per tuas [col. 313], "That it would be quite
