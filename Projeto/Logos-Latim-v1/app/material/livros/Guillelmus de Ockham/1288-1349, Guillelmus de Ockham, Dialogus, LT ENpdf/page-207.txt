ecclesias obtinuit principatum, quia si habuit principatum
a Deo non videtur quod possit illo principatu privari nisi
a solo Deo. Et ita usque in finem seculi est habitura
principatum, et per consequens numquam contra fidem
errabit. Si autem habuit principatum ab homine non
video quare ipsa non possit errare contra fidem sicut alie
particulares ecclesie. Unde peto ut, aliqualiter a
principali proposito disgrediendo, de hac re cures
disserere quid scolastici senciant indicando. Bene enim
postea ad propositum principale faciam te reverti.

church acquired rule over all other churches,
because if it obtained rule from God it does not
seem possible for it to be deprived of that rule
except by God alone. And thus it will have that rule
until the end of the age, and consequently it will
never err against faith. If it obtained its rule from a
man, however, I do not see why it can not err
against faith like other particular churches. So I ask
you to digress a little from the main theme and to
take time to discuss this matter by indicating what
scholars think of it. For later I will surely get you to
return to the main theme.

How did the Roman Church come to rule all other churches?
Magister De principatu seu primatu Romane ecclesie
diversi diversas et adversas affirmant sentencias,
quibusdam dicentibus quod nec beatus Petrus nec aliquis
successor eius nec Romana ecclesia super alias ecclesias
habuit a Deo seu a Christo primatum; ymmo dicunt quod
nec beatus Petrus ex ordinacione Christi superior fuit
aliis apostolis nec aliquis episcopus ex ordinacione
Christi est superior alio. Unde 6 asserciones circa hanc
materiam probare nituntur. Prima est quod beatus Petrus
ex ordinacione Christi non habuit super alios apostolos
principatum. Secunda est quod beatus Petrus non fuit
Romanus episcopus. Tercia est quod beatus Petrus ex
ordinacione apostolorum super alios apostolos primatum
obtinuit. Quarta est quod ex ordinacione Christi nullus
sacerdos super alios habet aliquam potestatem. Quinta
est quod ecclesia Romana ante tempora Constantini
super alias ecclesias non habuit principatum. Sexta est
quod Romana ecclesia ab ipso Constantino imperatore
super alias ecclesias primatum accepit.

Master: Different people assert different and
opposing opinions about the rule or primacy of the
Roman church, with some saying that neither
blessed Peter nor any successor of his nor the
Roman church had primacy from God or Christ over
other churches. Indeed they say that neither was
blessed Peter superior to the other apostles by
Christ's ordination nor is any bishop superior to any
other by Christ's ordination. Whence they try to
prove six assertions about this matter.
The first is that blessed Peter did not have rule over
the other apostles by Christ's decree..
The second is that blessed Peter was not bishop of
Rome.
The third is that blessed Peter acquired primacy over
the other apostles by decree of the apostles.
The fourth is that no priest has any power over other
[priests] by Christ's decree.
[See Significant Variants, para. 33.]The fifth is that
before the time of Constantine the church of Rome
did not have rule over other churches.
The sixth is that the church of Rome received
primacy over other churches from the emperor
Constantine himself.

Discipulus De istis conclusionibus valde miror quod eas
aliquis literatus tenere presumit; Veruntamen ob
exercitanda ingenia mociua eorum audire desidero, quia
ex ipsis forsitan veritas clarius elucescet.

Student: I am very surprised that anyone learned
presumes
to
maintain
those
conclusions.
Nevertheless in order to exercise my wits I want to
hear their arguments because perhaps from them the
truth will shine more clearly.

(1) Christ did not appoint Peter to rule the other apostles
Magister Primam assercionem, quod videlicet beatus
Petrus super alios apostolos ex ordinacione Christi non
habuit principatum auctoritatibus Scripture Divine et
sanctorum probare nituntur. Talem autem possunt facere
racionem. Beatus Petrus super illos a Christo nullum
habuit principatum qui equalem potestatem seu

Master: They try to prove the first assertion, namely
that blessed Peter did not obtain rule over the other
apostles by Christ's ordination, by texts from the
divine scriptures and from the saints. They can,
however, make the following argument. Blessed
Peter obtained no rule from Christ over those who
