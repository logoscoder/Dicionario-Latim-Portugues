possunt esse meliores clericis. Sicut ergo tota multitudo
laicorum potest contra fidem errare, ita tota multitudo
clericorum poterit contra fidem errare.

than the clergy." It is clearly implied by these words
that the laity can be better than the clergy. Just as the
whole multitude of the laity can err against faith,
therefore, so it will be possible for the whole
multitude of the clergy to err against faith.

Septimum motivum eorum est tale. Multitudo illorum
potest contra fidem errare qui possunt peccare et de
quibus vix invenitur aliquis vere penitens post
peccatum, quia peccatum excecat intellectum et ita
tandem poterit, si per penitenciam minime deleatur, ad
errorem contra fidem deducere. Sed clerici omnes
possunt peccare, et de clericis vix aliquis invenitur vere
penitens post peccatum, teste Iohanne Chrysostomo,
qui, ut habetur De penitencia dist. 1, c. Quis aliquando,
ait, "Quis aliquando vidit clericum cito penitenciam
agentem? Et, si deprehensus, humiliaverit se. Non ideo
dolet quia peccavit, sed confunditur quia perdit gloriam
suam." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi quod clerici raro
inveniuntur vere penitentes. Ergo temerarium est
asserere quod tota multitudo clericorum numquam
contra fidem errabit.

Their seventh reason is as follows. The multitude of
those who can sin and among whom scarcely anyone
is found who is truly penitent after sin can err against
faith, because sin blinds the understanding and so can
lead at length to error against faith if it is not
destroyed by penitence. But all the clergy can sin and
scarcely anyone who is truly penitent after sin is
found among the clergy, as John Chrysostom attests.
As we find in De poenitencia, dist. 1, c. Quis
aliquando, he says [col.1184], "Who has sometimes
seen a cleric quickly doing penance? If he is
discovered, he humbles himself. It is not in this case
that he sorrows because he has sinned, but he is
confused because he loses his honour." We are given
to understand by these words that truly penitent
clergy are rarely found. It is rash to affirm, therefore,
that the whole multitude of the clergy will never err
against faith.

Octavum motivum eorum est tale. Multitudo illorum
potest contra fidem errare qui, sola dignitate
ecclesiastica virtutes et graciam minime necessario
conferente nec augente, alios catholicos et fideles
noscuntur precellere, quia ex quo per talem dignitatem
gracia et virtutes neque conferuntur necessario neque
augentur nichil habent quare non possunt, sicut prius,
contra fidem errare. Sed clerici ultra laicos catholicos et
fideles nichil necessario obtinent nisi clericatum, qui
potest dignitas ecclesiastica appellari. Nulla autem
dignitas ecclesiastica in ecclesia militante confert
necessario graciam et virtutes nec necessario auget,
sicut in superioribus per auctoritates plurimas est
ostensum. Ergo tota multitudo clericorum potest contra
fidem errare, sicut poterant omnes errare contra fidem
quando laici extiterunt.

Their eighth reason is as follows. The multitude of
those who are known to excel other catholics and
believers in ecclesiastical dignity alone, which does
not necessarily confirm nor increase virtues and
grace, can err against faith because, since grace and
virtues are neither necessarily conferred nor are
increased by such a dignity, there is nothing through
which they can not err against faith, just as before.
But the clergy possess nothing more than lay
catholics and believers necessarily except their
clerical status, which can be called an ecclesiastical
dignity. No ecclesiastical dignity in the church
militant, however, necessarily confers grace and
virtues nor necessarily increases them, as was shown
above by many texts. Therefore the whole multitude
of the clergy can err against faith, just as they were
all able to err against faith when they were laymen.

Nonum eorum motivum est tale. Si tota multitudo
clericorum non potest contra fidem errare, sicut tota
multitudo laicorum potest contra fidem errare, aut hoc
est racione regiminis et auctoritatis quam habent clerici
super laicos, aut racione maioris sanctitatis qua clerici
pollent, aut racione maioris sapiencie et literature quam
habent clerici ultra laicos, aut quia, tota multitudine
clericorum errante, tota fides periclitaretur catholica.

Their ninth reason is this. If the whole multitude of
the clergy can not err against faith, just as the whole
multitude of the laity can err against faith, this is
either by reason [1] of the rule and authority that the
clergy have over the laity or [2] by reason of the
greater holiness in which the clergy are powerful or
[3] by reason of the wisdom and learning the clergy
have which is greater than that of the laity or [4]
because the whole catholic faith would be
endangered if the whole multitude of the clergy were
to err.

Non propter primum, tum quia, sicut dictum est,
dignitas aut regimen ecclesiasticum non necessario

It is not so because of the first [reason] [1]both
because, as has been said, ecclesiastical dignity or
