congregatis in unum assistit, ipsa veritate testante que
ait Matthei 18 c., "Ubi sunt duo vel tres congregati in
nomine meo, ibi ego sum in medio eorum." Et ideo licet
convenientes ad concilium generale ante potuerint
contra fidem errare, postquam tamen convenerint et
simul remanserint in nomine Christi errare non
poterunt.

particularly helps those who have come together as
one, as the Truth himself testifies when he says in
Matthew 18[:20], "Where there are two or three
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them." And therefore even though those coming
together at a general council were able to err against
faith beforehand, nevertheless after they have come
together and remained together in Christ's name they
will not be able to err.

Magister Ista responsio impugnatur, quia licet Deus
assistat specialiter congregatis in unum in nomine
Christi, ipsi tamen in gracia et in fide minime
confirmantur, eciam dum simul remanserint, quin
possint per liberum voluntatis arbitrium, eciam dum
simul localiter manserint, a gracia Dei et fide recedere.
Et ideo quamvis Deus specialiter assistat ad generale
concilium congregatis in nomine Christi, tamen per
talem assistenciam divinam in fide nullatenus
confirmantur quin possint labi in errorem. Unde per
istam responsionem haberetur quod nullum provinciale
concilium posset errare contra fidem, quia si, cum in
unum convenerint in nomine Christi in provinciali
concilio congregati, Deus specialiter assistit eisdem,
sequeretur eciam per idem medium quod generale vel
provinciale capitulum monachorum vel religiosorum
mendicancium non posset contra fidem errare quia
nonnumquam in nomine Christi congregantur.

Master: That reply is attacked, because although
God especially helps those who have gathered
together as one in Christ's name they are
nevertheless, even while they remain together, not
confirmed in grace and faith so that by the free
judgement of their will they can not withdraw from
God's grace and from faith even while they remain
together in that place. And therefore although God
especially helps those who have gathered together at
a general council in Christ's name, they are
nevertheless not confirmed in faith by such divine
help so that they can not fall into error. So, it would
be held by that reply that no provincial council could
err against faith because, if God especially helps
those who have gathered together as one in Christ's
name in a provincial council, it would also follow by
the same means that a general or provincial Chapter
of monks or mendicant religious could not err against
faith because they sometimes gather together in
Christ's name.

Quarta racio eorum est hec. Nulla vocacio humana
certarum personarum, nec eciam aliqua humana
commissio facta specialibus personis, potest eas in fide
confirmare vel eciam ab errore preservare, quia sola
potencia Dei ecclesia catholica ab erroribus preservatur.
Sed certe persone congregate in generali concilio non
vocantur nisi vocacione humana, nec aliquam
auctoritatem vel potestatem recipiunt nisi ex
commissione humana. Ergo per hoc quod in generali
concilio convenerunt nec confirmantur in fide nec ab
erroribus necessario preservantur. Ergo ita poterunt
postquam ad generale concilium fuerint congregati
incidere in hereticam pravitatem sicut ante potuerunt.

Their fourth argument is this. No human summoning
of particular people, nor also any human
commissioning directed towards particular people,
can confirm them in faith or even preserve them from
error, because the catholic church is preserved from
errors only by the power of God. But particular
people who have gathered together in a general
council are called only by a human summons and do
not receive any authority or power except by human
commission. From the fact that they have come
together in a general council, therefore, they are
neither confirmed in faith nor necessarily preserved
from errors. In the same way, therefore, they will be
able to fall into heretical wickedness after they have
gathered together in a general council just as they
could before.

Quinta racio eorum est hec. Si in generali concilio
congregati contra fidem errare non possunt, aut hoc est
racione sapiencie qua prefulgent, aut racione sanctitatis
qua pollent, aut racione auctoritatis seu potestatis quam
habent, aut racione promissionis Christi qua promisit
apostolis fidem usque ad finem seculi duraturam. Non
propter primum, tum quia sepe multi sapientes catholici
inveniuntur extra concilium generale qui possunt
defendere fidem licet omnes errarent in concilio

Their fifth argument is this. If those gathered together
in a general council can not err against faith this is
either by reason of the wisdom by which they shine,
by reason of the holiness in which they are strong, by
reason of the authority or power which they have or
by reason of Christ's promise by which he promised
the apostles that the faith would last until the end of
the age. It is not on account of the first [reason], both
because many wise catholics are often found outside
