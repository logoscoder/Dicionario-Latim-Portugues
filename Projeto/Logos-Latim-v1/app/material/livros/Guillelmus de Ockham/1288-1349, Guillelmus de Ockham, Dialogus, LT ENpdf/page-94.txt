spontaneam nullo metu coactam signare videtur. Et ita
talis esset pertinax haeresis defensator sed tamen non
esset haereticus nec etiam haeresim pertinaci
animositate defenderet propter metum mortis illatum.
Aliter dicerent quod sicut animositas ita etiam
pertinacia voluntatem spontaneam nullo mortis metu
coactam importat. Et ideo talis nec etiam pertinax est
censendus.

error with pertinacious ill will because "ill will" seems
to signify a free will not forced by fear. And so such a
person would be a pertinacious defender of heresy,
but yet he would not be a heretic nor, on account of
the fear of death that has been introduced, would he
also be defending a heresy with pertinacious ill will.
In another way they would say that, like ill will,
pertinacity too implies a free will unforced by any fear
of death. And therefore such a person should not, also,
be considered pertinacious.

Discipulus Nunc dicas quid sentiunt isti de secundo
quod ponit Augustinus?

Student Would you now tell me what they think
about the second point that Augustine puts.

Magister Dicunt quod secundum Augustinum qui
audacia suae praesumptionis falsam sententiam atque
contra fidem inveniunt, licet quandoque talem
sententiam nulla pertinaci animositate defendant, sunt
pertinaces et haeretici iudicandi. Si autem non audacia
suae praesumptionis sed ex simplicitate vel ignorantia
aliquam haeresim invenirent, et factum eorum nihil
aliud aggravaret nec per aliquid aliud possent convinci
ita non essent pertinaces nec haeretici iudicandi.
Qualiter autem innotescere possit quod quis non ex
audacia suae praesumptionis sed ex simplicitate vel
ignorantia errorem invenerit seu pepererit non potest
breviter explicari.

Master They say that according to Augustine those
who discover a false opinion against the faith from the
audacity of their own presumption should be judged
as pertinacious and heretical, even if sometimes they
do not defend such an opinion with pertinacious ill
will. However, if they did not discover some heresy
out of the audacity of their own presumption but out
of simplicity or ignorance, and nothing else were to
make their deed worse and they could not be
convicted of anything else, they should not be judged
pertinacious or heretical. It can not briefly be
explained, however, how it can become known that
someone has discovered or devised an error not out of
the audacity of his presumption but out of simplicity
or ignorance.

Discipulus De hoc postea diligenter inquiram. Nunc
autem isti ab intentione Augustini deviare videntur.
Nam in illa particula Augustinus duo simul coniungit
ut aliquos errantes a numero haereticorum excludat,
videlicet quod sententiam suam falsam non audacia
suae praesumptionis pepererint et quod eam a
parentibus seductis atque in errorem lapsis acceperint.
Ergo quicunque sententiam suam perversam a seductis
et in errorem lapsis parentibus non acceperit est
haereticus iudicandus, sicut quicunque sententiam
perversam audacia suae praesumptionis peperit est
secundum istos haereticus reputandus. Confirmatur
haec conclusio quia omnis qui non accipit sententiam
suam perversam ab alio ipsam ex audacia suae
praesumptionis parit quia aut habet eam a se aut ab
alio. Sed secundum istos quicunque haeresim ex
audacia suae praesumptionis peperit haereticus est
censendus. Ergo omnis errans contra fidem qui errorem
ab alio non acceperit est inter haereticos computandus.
Et ita videtur quod Augustinus ponit quinque ut
errantes a numero haereticorum excludat.

Student Later I will inquire into this carefully. Now,
however, they seem to deviate from Augustine's
intention. For in that clause Augustine joins two
things together to exclude some errants from the
number of the heretics, namely that they have not
devised their false opinion out of the audacity of their
own presumption and that they have received it from
parents led astray and fallen into error. Therefore
whoever has not received his evil opinion from
parents led astray and fallen into error should be
judged a heretic, just as whoever has devised an evil
opinion from the audacity of his own presumption
should be regarded as a heretic according to them.
This conclusion is confirmed because anyone who
does not receive his evil opinion from another
discovers it out of the audacity of his own
presumption, because he has it either from himself or
from another. But according to them whoever
discovered a heresy out of the audacity of his own
presumption should be considered a heretic. Everyone
erring against the faith, therefore, who has not
received his error from someone else should be
counted among the heretics. And so it seems that
Augustine proposes five [conditions] to exclude some
errants from the number of the heretics.

Magister Dicunt quod Augustinus illa duo simul iungit

Master They say that Augustine joins those two
