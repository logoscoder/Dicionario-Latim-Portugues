Ex quibus verbis habetur quod imperator

Again, the right to elect the supreme pontiff
can no less belong to the emperor than the
right to grant episcopates as he himself
wills and wishes at the request of the
supreme pontiff, because it seems less to
choose the supreme pontiff than for the
supreme pontiff to have to ask the emperor
to grant episcopates to suitable persons. But
the emperor has sometimes been able to
grant episcopates at his own pleasure to
suitable persons at the request of the
supreme pontiff. Hence, as we find in dist.
63, c. Reatina [c.16, col.239], Pope Leo,
when writing to the emperors Lotarius and
Ludovicus, says, "We beseech you in your
clemency to deign to grant to the humble
deacon Colonus rule of that same church,"
that is Reatina, "so that with your leave
received we can, with God's help consecrate
him as bishop in that place. If, however,
you do not want a bishop placed in
authority over that church, would your
serene highnesses deign to grant him the
church of Ausculanus which remains
deprived [of a head], so that, consecrated by
our papal dignity, he can offer thanks to the
omnipotent God and to your imperial
highnesses." We learn from these words
that the emperor could grant episcopates to
suitable people; the right to choose the
supreme pontiff, therefore, also belongs to
him.

Item illi potest {trs. &Mz} compete
{*competere &NaMzPeRe} ius eligendi
summum pontificem cuius iussione {vissione

ordinatio summi pontificis; sed iussione
imperatoris potest fieri ordinatio summi
pontificis, {sed iussione ... pontificis om.

Again, the right to choose the supreme
pontiff can belong to him by whose order
the ordination of the supreme pontiff can be
carried out; but by the emperor's order the
ordination of the supreme pontiff can be
carried out, because we find the following
in the Deeds of the Roman Pontiffs, as we
