pertinaciter contra Catholicam veritatem.

pertinaciously against Catholic truth is said to be a
heretic.

Discipulus Quare dicitur "qui putat aut putaverit" se Disciple Why is it said "who thinks or thought himself"
fuisse Christianum?
to have been a Christian?
Magister Dicitur propter illos qui extra formam
ecclesiae baptizantur, qui Christiani non sunt sed
putaverunt vel putant se esse Christianos; et tamen sunt
haeretici aliter quam Iudaei vel Pagani, et aliter sunt
puniendi.

Master It is said on account of those who are baptized
outside the Church's form, who are not Christians but
thought or think themselves Christians; and yet they are
heretics otherwise than Jews or pagans are, and should
be punished in another way.

Discipulus Dic si habet alias significationes hoc nomen Disciple Say if this word heretic has other meanings.
haereticus.
Magister Quinto modo dicitur haereticus omnis Master In a fifth way everyone who adheres
pertinaciter adhaerens errori qui sapit haereticam pertinaciously to an error which smacks of heretical
pravitatem.
wickedness is called a heretic.
Capitulum 3

Chapter 3

Discipulus Clare intueor plures significationes huius
nominis haereticus; in quibusdam tamen earum raro
accipitur, licet saepe de haereticis mentio fiat. Dic ergo
si audisti vel vidisti descriptionem huius nominis
haereticus in illa significatione in qua communius
accipitur.

Disciple I see clearly several meanings of this word
heretic, but in some of them it is seldom used, though
heretics are often mentioned. Say, therefore, if you
have heard or seen a description of this word heretic in
the meaning in which it is more commonly used.

Magister Forte tu intendis loqui de haeretico qui est
excommunicatus et, si fuerit convictus legitime et non
se correxerit secundum formam ecclesiae, est tradendus
curie seculari.

Master Perhaps you mean to speak of the heretic who
is excommunicate, and, if he has been lawfully
convicted and has not corrected himself according to
the Church's form, should be handed over to a secular
court.

Discipulus Illum describe si potes.

Disciple Describe him, if you can.

Definition (description) of a heretic
Magister Quidam describunt sic dicentes: Haereticus
est serio baptizatus, vel pro baptizato se gerens,
pertinaciter dubitans vel errans contra Catholicam
veritatem.

Master Some describe [him] saying this: A heretic is
someone seriously baptized, or behaving as someone
baptized, who pertinaciously doubts or errs against
Catholic truth.

Discipulus Declara particulas, et expone quas personas Disciple Clarify the elements [of this description], and
intendunt includere et quas excludere.
explain which persons they intend to include and which
to exclude.
Magister Per primam particulam, cum dicunt "serio
baptizatus", excludunt baptizatos iocose, qui pro non
baptizatis censentur. Comprehendunt autem per illam
eandem particulam non solum Christianos a Catholicis
baptizatos sed etiam baptizatos ab haereticis in forma
ecclesiae, et extra formam ecclesiae (qui sacramentum
baptismi nec quo ad gratiam nec quo ad characterem
quoquomodo suscipiunt). Per eandem etiam particulam
excludunt Iudaeos, Sarracenos et paganos qui nunquam
baptizati fuerunt nec pro baptizatis se gesserunt, qui
poena haereticorum de quibus loqueris sunt minime
feriendi.

Master By the first element, when they say "seriously
baptized", they exclude those baptized in jest who are
considered as not baptized. And they include by the
same element not only Christians baptized by
Catholics, but also those baptized by heretics in the
Church's form -- and outside the Church's form (who in
no way receive the sacrament of baptismi n respect of
either grace or character). By the same element they
exclude Jews, Saracens and pagans who have never
been baptized and have not behaved as baptized
persons, who should not at all be punished by the
penalty of the heretics of whom you were speaking.

Per secundam autem particulam, cum dicitur "pro And by the second element, when it is said "behaving
baptizato se gerens", comprehendunt illos qui putant vel as someone baptized", they include those who think or
fingunt se baptizatos et tanquam baptizati inter pretend that they have been baptized and live among
