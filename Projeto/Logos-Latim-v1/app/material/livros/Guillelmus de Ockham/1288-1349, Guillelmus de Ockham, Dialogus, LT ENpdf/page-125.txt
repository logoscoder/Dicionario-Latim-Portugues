Discipulus Si est alius modus errantem contra fidem de
pertinacia convincendi sum paratus audire.

Disciple If there is another way of convicting of
pertinacity someone erring against the faith I am
ready to listen to it.

Magister Dicunt nonnulli quod ille statim est pertinax
et haereticus iudicandus de quo est violenta
praesumptio quod negat aliquam assertionem quam scit
in Scriptura Divina vel determinatione ecclesiae
contineri, puta si probari potest quod prius assertionem
quam negat legerit cum intellectu in Scriptura Divina
vel determinatione ecclesiae, aut probari potest quod
prius eandem quam negat assertionem ex intentione
docuerat vel etiam asseruerat publice vel occulte. De
tali enim, si non est probabile quod oblitus fuerit illius
quod prius didicerat, est praesumptio violenta quod
scienter negat catholicam veritatem. Et per consequens
pertinax et haereticus est censendus.

Master Some say [fifth way] that he should be
judged immediately as pertinacious and a heretic of
whom there is a violent presumption that he denies
some assertion which he knows is contained in divine
scripture or in a determination of the church. If it can
be proved, for example, that he has previously read
and understood in divine scripture or a determination
of the church the assertion he denies, or if it can be
proved that previously he had purposefully taught or,
even, publicly or secretly affirmed the assertion he
denies. For if it is not probable that such a person has
forgotten what he had previously learnt there is a
violent presumption that he knowingly denies catholic
truth. And he should, as a consequence, be considered
pertinacious and a heretic.

Discipulus De isto modo ponas exemplum?

Disciple Would you offer an example of that way [of
convicting]?

Magister Sunt nonnulli qui de multis modernis ponunt
exemplum, de omnibus videlicet illis qui primo
docuerunt Christum et apostolos nullius rei
proprietatem habuisse, dicentes quod haec veritas ex
Scriptura Divina et determinatione ecclesiae manifeste
accipitur, et postea veritatem negaverunt eandem. Cum
non sit probabile quod Scripturae Divinae et eiusdem
determinationis ecclesiae sint obliti propter quod dicunt
illos pertinaces et haereticos esse censendos.

Master There are some who put forward an example
concerning many moderns, namely of all those who at
first taught that Christ and the apostles did not have
ownership of anything, saying that this truth is clearly
taken from divine scripture and a determination of the
church, and later denied that same truth. Since it is
not probable that they have forgotten divine scripture
and that determination of the church, they say that
those people should for that reason be considered
pertinacious and heretics.

Discipulus Istud exemplum tangit doctrinam domini
Iohannis papae 22 de qua alias tecum exquisite
tractabo. Ideo, isto exemplo dimisso, proba si potes
quod negantes catholicam veritatem quam prius
reputaverunt catholicam statim absque maiori
examinatione pertinaces et haeretici sunt censendi.

Disciple That example touches on the teaching of the
lord Pope John XXII which I will carefully discuss
with you on another occasion. Putting that example
aside, therefore, prove, if you can, that those who
deny a catholic truth which they had previously
considered catholic should be considered pertinacious
and heretics immediately and without more
questioning.

Magister Hoc probatur primo sic: qui scienter negat
catholicam veritatem est pertinax et haereticus
reputandus; sed talis scienter negat catholicam
veritatem, non enim potest se per ignorantiam excusare
cum prius didicerit eandem veritatem ad fidem
catholicam pertinere et non est oblitus eorum quae
didicit; ergo ex quo negat veritatem quam prius
didicerat et tenuerat est pertinax et haereticus
reputandus.

Master This is proved firstly, as follows. He who
knowingly denies a catholic truth should be regarded
as pertinacious and a heretic; but such a person does
knowingly deny catholic truth - for he can not excuse
himself by ignorance since he has previously learnt
that that truth pertains to catholic faith and has not
forgotten the things that he learnt; since he denies a
truth that he had previously learnt and held, therefore,
he should be regarded as pertinacious and a heretic.

Secundo sic: omnis apostata a catholica veritate est
pertinax et haereticus reputandus quia talis est apostata
a fide; apostata autem a fide inter haereticos

[See Significant Variants, para. 16.] [It is proved]
secondly as follows. Every apostate from catholic
truth should be regarded as pertinacious and a heretic
