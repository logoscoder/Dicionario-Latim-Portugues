Christianam esse veram, ergo tenetur credere explicite
ecclesiam universalem non errare nec errasse.

say, that this [argument] does not follow: "Every
christian is bound explicitly to believe that the
christian faith is true"; therefore, "he is bound
explicitly to believe that the universal church does not
err and has not erred."

Discipulus Non diffundas te circa illa quae ad
rationalem spectant scientiam, sed dic quomodo ad
rationem in contrarium respondetur.

Disciple Do not expatiate on matters that pertain to
rational science [i.e. logic] but describe say how reply
is made to the argument to the contrary.

Magister Ad rationem illam dicitur quod quandoque
magis tenetur quis credere conclusionem explicite
quam praemissas ex quibus infertur, propter hoc quod
conclusio magis quam praemissae apud catholicos
divulgatur. Ita est de ista, "ecclesia universalis non errat
nec erravit." Haec enim sub istis verbis vel
aequipollentibus apud omnes catholicos divulgatur.
Quilibet enim Christianus putat illam esse universalem
ecclesiam quae secum in fide concordat, et ideo, sicut
quilibet explicite credit se tenere veram fidem et non
falsam, ita quilibet credit explicite universalem
ecclesiam servare veram et catholicam fidem et non
falsam fidem. Quare sicut ista, "fides Christiana est
vera fides", est apud omnes Christianos divulgata, et
ideo quilibet tenetur eam explicite credere, ita ista,
"fides universalis ecclesiae est vera fides" est apud
omnes Christianos divulgata. Quare quilibet
Christianus eam tenetur explicite credere. Et ideo
quicunque illam negat est statim sine maiori
examinatione pertinax et hereticus reputandus.

Master To that argument it is said that sometimes one
is more bound explicitly to believe a conclusion than
the premises from which it is inferred, on the grounds
that the conclusion has been more widely published
among catholics than the premises. It is so about [the
conclusion] "the universal church does not err and has
not erred". For it has been published among all
catholics in those words or equivalent ones. For every
christian thinks that to be the universal church which
agrees with him in faith; and just as everyone believes
explicitly that he holds the true faith and not a false
faith, so everyone believes explicitly that the
universal church preserves the true and catholic faith
and not a false faith. Wherefore, just as it has been
published among all christians that "the christian faith
is the true faith", and everyone is bound, therefore,
explicitly to believe this, so it has been published
among all christians that "the faith of the universal
church is the true faith". Wherefore every christian is
bound explicitly to believe this; and whoever denies
it, therefore, should be regarded immediately and
without additional questioning as pertinacious and a
heretic.

Capitulum 10

Chapter 10

Discipulus Isti videntur distinguere inter universalem
ecclesiam et multitudinem Christianorum. Nunquid
igitur concedunt quod quilibet tenetur credere explicite
quod multitudo vel maior pars Christianorum non errat
nec erravit in fide?

Disciple They seem to distinguish between the
universal church and the multitude of christians. Do
they grant, therefore, that everyone is bound explicitly
to believe that the multitude, or the greater part, of
christians does not err and has not erred in faith?

Magister Respondetur quod non est necesse credere
neque implicite neque explicite multitudinem
Christianorum vel maiorem partem non errare in fide
nec errasse, pro eo quod fides catholica in paucis potest
servari; imo nonnulli dicunt quod in uno solo posset
consistere, quia per unum solum posset salvari
quicquid Christus promisit apostolis de fide catholica
usque ad finem seculi duratura.

Master The reply is that it is not necessary to believe
explicitly or implicitly that the multitude, or the
greater part, of christians does not err and has not
erred in faith, on the grounds that the catholic faith
can be preserved in a few people - indeed some say
that it could endure in one person alone, because
through one person alone whatever Christ promised to
the apostles about the catholic faith's lasting until the
end of time could be safeguarded.

Discipulus Nunquid est adhuc alius modus quo de
pertinacia valeat quis convinci?

Disciple Is there any other way by which someone
can be convicted of pertinacity?
