Discipulus Quid si imperator vellet impedire
electionem summi pontificis quando cardinales
effecti essent {sunt &Mz} haeretici vel si
{*om. &NaMzPeRe} nollet etiam {*om.

Student What if the emperor wanted to
hinder the election of the supreme pontiff
when the cardinals had become heretics or
did not want to involve himself even if asked
by the Romans?

Magister Respondetur quod in hoc casu
Romani possent et deberent {debent &Mz}
absque imperatore ad electionem prodecere,
quia, sicut dictum est prius, potestas eligendi
summum pontificem non competit imperatori
in quantum imperator iure divino vel {*et
&NaMzPeRe} iure gentium simul sed
competit sibi {om. &Pe} in quantum
catholicus et Romanus in quibus secum
convenirent {*conveniunt &NaMzPeRe}

Master The reply is that in this case the
Romans could and should proceed to the
election without the emperor because, as was
said earlier, the power to elect the supreme
pontiff does not belong to the emperor by
divine law and the law of nations as emperor
but as a catholic and a Roman, and other
Romans join him in this. Just as no other
Roman, therefore, can hinder the Romans,
who ought rather proceed to election in this

assertion it is said that when electors are
deprived of the right to elect, that right does
not always revert to those who had it
immediately before them, because in such a
case the right to elect is often allotted to their
superior, sometimes it even reverts to those
who had the right to elect by a more ancient
and general law. And although the emperor
had the right to elect immediately before the
cardinals, therefore, that right does not revert
or is not allotted to the emperor alone if the
cardinals become heretics, but reverts to him
and other Romans together, so that he,
together with other Romans, has the power to
make arrangements about how the Roman
bishop should be elected. In this matter,
nevertheless, the emperor does have a certain
prerogative over other Romans with respect
to the election of the supreme pontiff, so that
the Romans should not proceed to an election
or make arrangements about electors without
him, at least if his presence can be obtained
conveniently.
