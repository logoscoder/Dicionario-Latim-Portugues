Discipulus Hoc Graciano repugnare videtur,
qui ubi primo {*prius &NaRe} ait, "Christus
Iudeos ad se arguendum admisit perfectione
humilitatis, non severitate iuris. Si enim legis
rigore essent admissi, hac auctoritate criminosi
et {etiam &Na} infames in accusatione
religiosorum recipiendi essent, cum essent
sceleratissimi, qui de morte {*nece &NaReZn}
Christi tractantes innocentem condempnare
volebant." Ex quibus verbis comprehenditur
{om. &NaRe} [[add. interlinear Re]] quod
Christus ex rigore iuris accusari non poterat,
sed tantummodo ex perfectione humilitatis.

Student This seems to oppose Gratian who
says at this same place [col.495], "Christ
allowed the Jews to accuse him out of the
perfection of his humility, not out of the
strictness of the law. For if they had been
allowed out of the rigour of the law, the
guilty and notorious on this authority would
have been accepted in an accusation against
the religious, because they were very wicked
men who in discussing the death of Christ
wanted to condemn an innocent man." We
understand from these words that Christ
could not be accused out of the strictness of
the law, but only out of the perfection of his
humility.

Magister Ad hoc respondetur quod Christus
non poterat accusari ex severitate iuris, que
Christo necessitatem imponeret, quia Christus,
in quantum deus, supra omnem talem legem
fuit, et tamen, in quantum homo, ex
perfectione humilitatis sponte se subdidit
huiusmodi iuri, ut posset accusari ab illo, qui
erat recipiendus in publico, et ita Christus
subdidit erat {*iuri add. &NaRe}, in quantum
homo. Quia tamen sponte, etiam in quantum
homo, erat subditus huiusmodi iuri {trs. &Na},
ideo quodammodo fuit supra huiusmodi {huius
&Re} ius, quia in potestate sua fuit posse
accusari et non posse accusari {et non posse
accusari om. &Na}; et tamen quamdiu ex
perfectione humilitatis voluit, poterat accusari.
Ex quo sequitur quod quamdiu voluit ex
perfectione humilitatis, fuit subditus iudicibus
illis qui erant iudices in populo.

Master The reply to this is that Christ could
not be accused out of the strictness of the law
imposing its necessity on him, because, as
God, Christ was above every such law, and
yet, as a man, he willingly subjected himself
to such a law out of the perfection of his
humility, with the result that he could be
accused by him who should have received
him in public, and so, as a man, Christ
subjected himself to the law. Yet because,
even as a man, he willingly subjected himself
to a law of this kind, he was as a result to a
certain extent above that law because it was
in his power to be able to be accused and not
to be able to be accused; and yet just as long
as he consented out of the perfection of his
humility, he could be accused. It follows
from this that just as long as he consented out
of the perfection of his humility he was
subject to those judges who were judges
among the people.

Discipulus Istud est multum pro papa; quia
sicut Christus fuit subditus, quamdiu voluit,
iudicbus illis, qui iudicabant in partibus illis,
ita etiam papa potest se submittere, si voluerit,
iudicio laicorum. Set non est necessarie, quod
se submittat, et ita cum sit vicarius Christi, non
est subditus alicuius, nisi sponte vellet {*velit
&NaRe}.

Student That is very much for the pope [too],
because, just as Christ was subject, just as
long as he consented, to the secular judges
who used to judge in those parts, so also, if
he consents, can the pope submit himself to
the judgement of laymen. But he does not
submit himself necessarily, and so, since he is
the vicar of Christ, he is not subject to anyone
unless he consents willingly.
