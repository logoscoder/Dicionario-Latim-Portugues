not in any way conflict with the christian
religion for the totality of mortals to have one
supreme judge or many supreme [judges]
holding the same office. This seems provable
from what was said in the first chapter of the
first [book] of this [tractate], because the
totality of mortals is only best governed if it
is subjected to one ruler who has dominion
over everyone. Eleven arguments were
brought forward in that place to prove this.

Discipulus Dimittamus ad praesens loqui de
universitate mortalium, quorum aliqui sunt
fideles et aliqui infideles, et ideo forte nullo
modo concordarent in unum iudicem qui
omnes alios de omni crimine iudicaret, et
loquamur de tota communitate fidelium
quorum aliqui sunt laici {*et aliqui clerici add.
&NaRe}. Et videamus an ista communitas non
possit esse optime ordinata, quantum permittit
status vitae praesentis, nisi tota habeat unum
iudicem solum {*trs. &NaRe} et {*om.
&NaRe} summum {*supremum &NaRe} a
quo {*omnes add. &MzNaRe} alii pro
quocunque crimine debeant iudicari.

Student Let us give up for the moment
talking about the totality of mortals, some of
whom are believers and some unbelievers,
who would therefore perhaps not agree at all
about one judge who would judge all others
for any crime, and let us speak about the
whole community of believers, of whom
some are laymen and some clerics. And let us
see whether it is the case that that community
can not be best regulated, as much as the
condition of this present life allows, unless as
a whole it has one sole supreme judge by
whom all others should be judged for any
crime at all.

DOES THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, TO BE BEST GOVERNED, NEED ONE SUPREME JUDGE OF ALL
CRIMES?

Opinion 1: There need not be one supreme judge of all crimes

Magister Quia {*Quod &MzNaRe} tota
communitas fidelium non habet {*habeat
&MzNaRe} talem unicum {om. &NaRe}
iudicem summum {*supremum &NaRe}
potest poni pluribus modis.

Master That the whole community of
believers does not have such a single supreme
judge can be put in many ways.

Discipulus Explica modos illos ut de aliquibus Student Explain those ways so that we can

discuss some of them or each of them.
