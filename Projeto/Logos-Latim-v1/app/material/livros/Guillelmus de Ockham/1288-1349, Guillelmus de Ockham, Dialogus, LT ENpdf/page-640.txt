fundatur in hoc quod imperatores multas res
donaverunt {donarunt &Mz}?

argument which is based which is based on
the fact that emperors have presented many
things?

Magister Dicitur quod saepe multi donant res
plures et tamen {non &Pe} retinent sibi
dominium principale earundem rerum, et ideo
imperator potest alienare a se {alias add. &Na}
multas res non tamen sic quin in casibus multis
ipsas valeat revocare et pro utilitate communi
eas sibi appropriare, et ideo semper remaneat
{*remanet &MzNaRe} aliquo modo dominus
earundem.

Master It says that many people often
present many things and yet retain for
themselves principal lordship of them, and
therefore the emperor can deprive himself
of many things and yet not in such a way
that he can not in many cases recall them
and appropriate them to himself for the
common benefit, and therefore he always
remains lord of them in some way.

Discipulus Dic quomodo respondetur ad
quartam quae accipit quod imperator de praeda
capta in bello iusto habet portionem specialem.

Student Tell me how it replies to the fourth
[argument] which accepts that the emperor
has a special portion of the booty captured
in a just war.

Magister Dicitur {*respondetur &MzNaPeRe}
quod licet ius pinguius {*trs. &MzNaPeRe}
habeat {habet &Mz} {*in add. &MzNaPeRe}
portione speciali sibi assignata, est tamen
dominus quodammodo {*trs. &MzNaPeRe}
omnium {*om. &NaRe} aliarum portionum in
quantum pro {om. &Re} utilitate communi
potest eas sibi appropriare {*accipere
&MzNaRe}.

Master The reply is that although he has a
fuller right in the special portion assigned
to him, he is nevertheless to some extent
lord of the other portions in so far as he can
take them to himself for the common
benefit.

Discipulus dic {*om. &MzNaPeRe} Qualiter
respondetur ad quintam rationem {*om.
&MzNaRe} de rebus fisci?

Student How does it reply to the fifth
[argument] about the things of the fisc?

Magister {om. &Re} Respondetur quod
quamvis imperator in rebus fisci habeat
pinguius ius quam in aliis, propter tamen
rationes {trs. &Mz} dictas in omnibus etiam
aliis habet aliquo modo dominium.

Master The reply is that although the
emperor has a fuller right in the things of
the fisc than in other things, nevertheless
for the above reasons he has lordship in
some way in all other things too.

Discipulus Quid dicitur de sexta quae accipit
quod si imperator est dominus omnium aut

Student What does it say about the sixth
[argument] which accepts that if the
