Rusticus, "Among bees there is one ruler;
cranes follow one of their number in learned
order; there is one emperor and one judge in a
province. When Rome was founded it could
not have two brothers as kings at the same
time and is destined for parricide. [[This
word to be broadly interpreted, as the gloss
says.]] In Rebecca's womb Esau and Jacob
waged war; single bishops of churches, single
archbishops, single archdeacons; and the
whole ecclesiastical order rests on its rulers."
In these words Jerome clearly proves by
many examples that in the same church there
should not be many prelates, one of whom is
not under another. It can equally or more
clearly be shown by them that there should
not be many supreme judges in the same
community, because if by the singleness of
the ruler of bees the singleness of a bishop in
one diocese and the singleness of an
archbishop in one archdiocese can be shown,
by the same argument from the singleness of
the ruler of bees the singleness of a supreme
judge over one community or congregation
can be shown.
Again, if the singleness of a bishop and
archbishop is shown from the fact that cranes
follow one of their number, by a similar
argument the singleness of a supreme judge
over one community is shown from this.
Similarly, if the singleness of a bishop, an
archbishop and other rulers of the church is
shown from the fact that once Rome was
founded it could not have two brothers as
kings at the same time but was destined for
parricide, the singleness of a supreme judge
over the same community can much more
strongly be proved from this, that is that there
not be two, namely one ecclesiastical and one
secular, because it seems that it should not be
any the less presumed that a secular judge
will oppose an ecclesiastical one, even as far
as killing him, just as one of the founding
brothers of Rome killed the other, than that
one ecclesiastical judge [will oppose] the
other or one bishop [oppose] the other. If it
