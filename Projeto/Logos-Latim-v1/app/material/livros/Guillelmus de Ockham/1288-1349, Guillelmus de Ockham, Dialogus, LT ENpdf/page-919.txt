est quod ab haereticis venientes recipiendi
sunt."

be accepted."

Item Gregorius, ut habetur dist. 12, c. Nos
consuetudinem, loquens de Donatistis
episcopis revertentibus ad fidem ait, "Sufficiat
autem illis," {*scilicet add. &NaRe} episcopis
Donatistis venientibus ad catholicam fidem,
"commissae sibi plebis curam gerere."

Again, (3) as we find in dist. 12, c. Nos
consuetudinem [c.8, col.28], Gregory,
speaking about the Donatist bishops returning
to the faith, says, "Let it be enough for them,
however," that is the Donatist bishops
coming back to the catholic faith, "to take
care of the people committed to them."

Propter ista videtur {videntur &NaRe} quod
praedicta {*non add. &NaMzPeRe} sunt
{*sint &NaPeRe} consona veritati. Tu vero dic
quomodo respondetur {om. &NaRe} ad illa
{*ipsa &NaRe}.

It seems from these [objections] that the
things said above are not in accord with the
truth. Now tell me how reply is made to them
[the objections].

Magister Ad primum istorum dicitur
{respondetur &Pe} quod si Romani omnes
efficerentur haeretici ius eligendi summum
pontificem amitterent, et secundum quorundam
{*quamdam &NaMzPeRe} assertionem non
recuperarent ius eligendi licet {sed &Pe} ab
{de &Pe} haeresi reverterentur ad fidem; sed
{*om. &NaPeRe} secundum aliam
recuperarent idem ius propter hoc quod
immediate ex ordinatione Christi et iure
gentium habent ius eligendi.

Master To the first of them it is said that if all
the Romans were to become heretics they
would lose the right to elect the supreme
pontiff; and according to one teaching they
would not recover the right to elect even if
they were to turn back from heresy to the
faith; according to another [teaching] they
would recover the same right because of the
fact that they have the right to elect directly
by Christ's decree and by the law of nations.

Discipulus Ubi ordinavit Christus quod
Romani haberent ius eligendi summum
{romanum &NaRe} pontificem?

Student Where did Christ decree that the
Romans were to have the right to elect the
supreme pontiff?

Magister Respondetur {om. &Mz} quod tunc
hoc ordinavit quando fecit beatum Petrum
caput et pontificem omnium Christianorum,
dans ei potestatem eligendi sibi locum ubi
poneret sedem suam, et non privavit illos,
quorum {*beatus Petrus add. &NaPeRe}
eligeret {elegerit &Mz} esse episcopus
quodammodo {quodam &Pe} proprius
{proprio &Pe} iure eligendi et ibi {*et ibi: sibi
&NaPeRe} praeficiendi {*praeficiendum
&NaPeRe}, quod eis competit ex iure gentium,

Master The reply is that he decreed this at
the time when he made blessed Peter head
and pontiff of all christians, giving him the
power to elect for himself the place where he
would establish his seat, and he did not
deprive those whose, to some extent special,
bishop blessed Peter chose to be, of their
right to elect someone to be set over them, [a
right] which belongs to them by the law of
nations, although not in such a way that the
opposite can not licitly be ordained and
