Secundo quia, sicut notat glossa dist. 28, c. De
Syracusane {om. &Re} [[gap left in ms]]
cautela, {c. add. &Mz} "Debet adhiberi
{*debet adbiberi: Not. caveri debere &Zn} ex

potest colligi manifeste. Sed saepe accidit quod
electores summi pontificis propter haereticam
pravitatem fuerunt potestate eligendi privati.
Igitur {*Ergo &MzNaRe} saltem tunc de

{iure divino om. &Pe} quia {*sed

Secondly because, as the gloss on dist. 28, c.
De Syracusane cautela [col. 140] notes,
"Note that one should be on one's guard from
the fact that something is customarily done,
as" can be clearly gathered "in dist. 98, c.
Affros and dist. 63, c. Nosse." But it has often
happened that the electors of the supreme
pontiff have been deprived of their power to
elect because of heretical wickedness. At that
time at least, therefore, provision should have
been made by human law for how the
supreme pontiff should be elected, if
provision had not been made for this in
divine law. But at that time no human law
was promulgated on the subject. It should be
gathered, therefore, from divine law and by
evident reason how the supreme pontiff
should be elected if the electors are deprived
of the power to elect and there is no pope
who can grant election to others. This does
not seem to be something that has to be
proved, except that it has often happened that
the electors of the supreme pontiff have been
deprived of their power to elect because of
heresy. This is proved by the fact that
emperors have often had the power to elect
the highest pontiff and later have been
deprived of the right because of heretical
wickedness. Gratian attests to this when he
says in dist. 63, para Verum [c.28, col.244],
"[Because ... ] having fallen frequently even
into the treachery of the heretics, they," that
is emperors, "have attempted to attack the
unity of our catholic mother the church, the
statutes of the holy fathers have come out
against them so that they would not involve
themselves in any election."
