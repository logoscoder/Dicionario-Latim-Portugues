ipso iure depositus, sicut in prima parte
Dialogi huius {*trs. &MzNaRe} libro sexto
per quamplurimas rationes probatum existit, et
ideo licet {*om. &MzNaRe} pro favore
haereticae pravitatis quae {?qui MzNa} {add.

depositus ipso facto, tamen pro solo favore
haereticorum absque favore errorum {*erroris

scandalizetur ecclesia.

proved by very many arguments in book 6 of
the first part of this Dialogue, and therefore is
ipso facto deposed for support of heretical
wickedness which [does not] exist without
heresy in the supporter, yet the pope is not
ipso facto deposed solely because of support
for heretics without support of their error;
indeed according to some he should not even
be deposed unless he seems to be incorrigible
and the church is caused to stumble because
of it.

Cum autem dicitur quod Anastasius secundus
non fuit depositus nisi pro favore
haereticorum, respondetur quod non est verum;
imo fuit depositus pro haeresi et fautoria
haereticae pravitatis, quod ex textu dist. 19 et
glossa ut videtur colligitur evidenter. Ait enim
Gratianus eadem dist. para. Hoc autem,
"Anastasius enim secundus {episcopus add.
&MzNaRe} favore Anastasii imperatoris quos
Achacius post sententiam in se prolatam
sacerdotes et {*vel &Zn} levitas ordinaverat
acceptis officiis rite fungi debere decrevit" et
{*om. &NaRe} erronee {*erronea &NaRe}
supple. Unde in {*om. &MzNaRe} para.
sequenti dicit Gratianus, "Quia ergo illicite et
non canonice, sed contra decreta {dei add. Zn}
praedecessorum et successorem suorum haec
rescripta dedit, ut probat Felix et Gelasius qui
Achacium ante {*Anastasium add.
&MzNaReZn} excommunicaverunt et
Hormisda qui ab ipso Anastasio tertius eundem
Achacium postea damnavit, ideo a Romana
ecclesia repudiatur et a Deo percussus fuisse
legitur."

When it is said, however, that Anastasius II
was deposed only for the support of heretics,
it is said that this is not true; rather he was
deposed for heresy and for promoting
heretical wickedness, which seems to be
clearly gathered from the text and gloss of
dist. 19. For in the paragraph Hoc autem [c.7,
col.62] of that distinction Gratian says, "For
Anastasius II with the support of the emperor
Anastasius decreed that the bishops or levites
whom Achatius had ordained after the
sentence published against him should duly
discharge the offices they had received" --understand "erroneously". Whence Gratian
says in the following paragraph [Quia ergo
c.8, col.645], "Therefore because he issued
these rescripts illicitly and not canonically,
but contrary to the decrees of his
predecessors and successors, as Felix and
Gelasius, who excommunicated Achatius
before Anastasius, and Hormisda, third in
line after Anastasius who later condemned
Achatius, prove, he is as a result repudiated
by the Roman church and was, we read,
struck by God."

Item glossa super c. Anastasius super verbo
abegerunt ait, "Hi non recesserunt, scilicet
clerici, ab Anastasio ante sententiam, quia
inciderat {*inciderunt Zn} in haeresim iam
damnatam." Tunc {*Item &NaRe} super verbo
communicaverat dicit glossa, "Hic
communicavit, scilicet Anastasius, cum {*ei,
scilicet &MzNaRe} Achacio haeretico, in

Again the gloss on the words "drove out" in
[dist. 19] c. Anastasius [col. 87] says, "They,
that is the clerics, did not withdraw from
Anastasius before the sentence because they
had fallen into a heresy that was already
condemned." Again on the words "had
participated" the gloss says, "He, that is
Anastasius, participated in wickedness with
