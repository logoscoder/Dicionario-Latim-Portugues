Magister Multorum iudicio bene dixisti hoc quod petis
utile esse ad multa quia nonnulli ex declaratione ipsius
multa probare conantur. Dicitur itaque quod sicut
"impenitens" dupliciter accipitur, uno modo pro illo qui
penitere non potest, alio modo pro illo qui est in
proposito minime penitendi, sic incorrigibilis dupliciter
dicitur, uno modo ille qui non potest corrigi - et talis
non est in hac vita praesertim si non est alienatus a
sensu. Aliter dicitur ille incorrigibilis qui est in
proposito se nullatenus corrigendi, licet possit corrigi.
Et omnis talis incorrigibilis debet pertinax reputari.
Unde talis incorrigibilis vocari potest pertinax,
contumax, obstinatus et induratus. Non igitur, sicut
accipis, qui corrigi potest non est incorrigibilis; imo
multi sunt incorrigibiles qui sunt in proposito se
nullatenus corrigendi, qui tamen corrigi possunt; et
saepe incorrigibiles corriguntur, quia de nullo
incorrigibili in vita praesenti est penitus desperandum,
sicut nec de aliquo impenitente quamdiu vixerit est
desperandum.

Master In the judgement of many people you have
said truly that what you seek is beneficial to many
[problems] because some people try to prove a great
deal by an explanation of it. And so it is said that just
as "impenitent" is taken in two ways - in one way for
him who can not do penance, in another way for him
who has no intention of doing penance - so
"incorrigible" is said in two ways: in one way, he who
can not be corrected - and in this life no one is like
that, especially if he is not insane - and in another way
he is said to be incorrigible who has no intention of
correcting himself, although he can be corrected.
Everyone incorrigible in this way should be regarded
as pertinacious. Consequently such an incorrigible
person can be called pertinacious, contumacious,
obstinate and hardened. It is not, therefore, as you
take it, that he who can not be corrected is
incorrigible; rather many are incorrigible who have no
intention of correcting themselves although they can,
nevertheless, be corrected; and often those who are
incorrigible are corrected, because no one who is
incorrigible should be wholly despaired of in this life,
just as no one who is impenitent should be despaired
of as long as he is alive.

Chapter 8

Discipulus Dic alium modum quo de pertinacia debeat
quis convinci.

Disciple Describe another way by which someone
should be convicted of pertinacity.

Magister Dicunt nonnulli quod ille debet pertinax
iudicari qui tenet ecclesiam universalem errare vel
errasse ex quo cepit ecclesia Christiana congregari,
licet credat fidem Christianam traditam a Christo et
apostolis in nulla sui parte mendacium continere. Talis
enim, ut dicunt, non est examinandus an paratus sit
corrigi, sed eo ipso quod hoc dicit est pertinax
reputandus.

Master Some say [third way] that he who holds that
the universal church errs or has erred since the
christian church began to gather together ought to be
judged as pertinacious, even if he believes that the
christian faith handed down by Christ and the apostles
contains nothing which is false. For they say that such
a person should not be examined about whether he is
ready to be corrected but, by the very fact that he says
this, he should be regarded as pertinacious.

Discipulus Nunquid omnes literati sic sentiunt?

Disciple Do all the learned think this way?

Magister Quidam tenent contrarium, dicentes quod
absque pertinacia et haeretica pravitate potest quis ex
simplicitate et ignorantia dicere ecclesiam errare vel
errasse. Et ideo sic dicens est examinandus sollicite an
paratus sit corrigi. Et si quidem paratus sit corrigi non
est pertinax nec haereticus iudicandus; si autem corrigi
nolit est inter pertinaces et haereticos numerandus.

Master Some hold the contrary, saying that out of
simplicity and ignorance someone can say without
pertinacity and heretical wickedness that the church
errs or has erred. And one who says this, therefore,
should be examined punctiliously about whether he is
ready to be corrected; and if he is indeed ready to be
corrected he should not be judged as pertinacious or a
heretic; if he refuses to be corrected, however, he
should be numbered among the pertinacious and the
heretics.
