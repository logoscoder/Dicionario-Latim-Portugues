Reply to arguments that the Cardinals cannot become heretics
Magister Ad primam illarum respondetur quod Romana
ecclesia multipliciter accipitur aliquando accipitur pro
universali ecclesia: aliquando pro papa: aliquando pro
clero et populo Romano: aliquando pro collegio
Cardinalium. Illa autem ecclesia Romana que errare non
potest est universalis ecclesia et non collegium
cardinalium.

Master: The reply to the first of them is that 'Roman
church' is taken in many ways. Sometimes it is taken
as the universal church, sometimes as the pope,
sometimes as the clergy and people of Rome,
sometimes as the college of cardinals. However, the
Church that cannot err is the universal Church, and
not the college of cardinals.

Discipulus Circa istam materiam non dicas hic amplius
quia de ea postea te interrogabo, sed dic quomodo
respondetur ad secundam racionem.

Student: Would you not say more about that matter
here because I will ask you about it later. But tell
how reply is made to the second argument.

Magister Ad secundam dicunt quidam quod per sedem
apostolicam aliquando intelligitur papa, aliquando
dyocesis sua, aliquando papa cum collegio cardinalium,
aliquando ecclesia universalis. Illa autem sedes
apostolica que errare non potest contra fidem secundum
aliquos est universalis ecclesia, secundum quosdam
vero est Romana dyocesis.

Master: Some people reply to the second that by
'apostolic see' sometimes the pope is meant,
sometimes his diocese, sometimes the pope with the
college of cardinals, sometimes the universal church.
According to some people, however, that apostolic
see which can not err against faith is the universal
church but according to others it is the Roman
diocese.

Discipulus De hoc eciam ad presens supersedeas et dic
ad terciam racionem.

Student: Would you pass over this now too and
speak to the third argument.

Magister Ad terciam racionem respondetur quod sicut
imperator, qui aliquando habuit potestatem eligendi
summum pontificem, ut habetur in decretis dist. 63, c.
Adrianus et c. In synodo, potuit hereticam incurrere
pravitatem, ita eciam illud collegium quod nunc habet
potestatem eligendi summum pontificem potest
pravitate heretica maculari.

Master: A reply to the third argument is that just as
the emperor, who once had the power to choose the
highest pontiff, as we find in the decretals at dist. 63,
c. Adrianus [col.241] and c. In synodo [col.241],
could have incurred heretical wickedness, so too that
college which now has the power to choose the
highest pontiff can be stained with heretical
wickedness.

Discipulus Si illud collegium hereticaretur nullus in
ecclesia Dei haberet potestatem eligendi summum
pontificem, et ita ecclesie Dei de eligendo summum
pontificem non esset sufficienter provisum.

Student: If that college were to become heretical no
one in the church of God would have the power to
choose the highest pontiff and so there would not be
sufficient provision made for the church of God in
the choice of the highest pontiff.

Magister Respondetur quod sufficienter provisum est
quia si collegium cardinalium hereticaretur eleccio
devolveretur ad Romanos. Si autem, sicut dicunt aliqui,
esset possibile quod omnes Romani hereticarentur,
potestas eligendi summum pontificem devolveretur ad
alios orthodoxos.

Master: The reply is that sufficient provision has
been made because if the college of cardinals were to
become heretical the choice would devolve upon the
Romans. If, however, as some people say, it would
be possible for all the Romans to become heretical,
the power to choose the highest pontiff would
devolve upon the other orthodox.

Discipulus De hoc alias tecum collacionem habebo,
ideo narra quomodo respondetur ad quartam racionem.

Student: I will discuss this with you elsewhere, so
tell me how reply is made to the fourth argument.

Magister Respondetur ad illam racionem distinguendo,
quia aut papa publice et notorie incidit in heresim
manifestam explicite iam dampnatam, et in isto casu
non solum collegium cardinalium, si in fide

Master: A reply is made to that argument by making
a distinction, because [i] either the pope publicly and
notoriously falls into a manifest heresy already
explicitly condemned -- and in that case not only the
