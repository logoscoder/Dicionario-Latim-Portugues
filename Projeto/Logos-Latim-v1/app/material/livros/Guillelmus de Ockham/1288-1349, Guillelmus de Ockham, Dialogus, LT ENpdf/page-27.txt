noscuntur, sicut quod Pharao, Madianitae, Chananei et
alii infideles quamplurimi multas terras occupaverunt
et filios Israel multipliciter afflixerunt.

some extent, not directly but indirectly, to the
salvation of human kind, such as that Pharaoh, the
Medes, the Canaanites and very many other
unbelievers occupied many lands and afflicted the
children of Israel in many ways.

Nonnullae etiam veritates huiusmodi extra praedictum
canonem continentur quae tamen per revelationem vel
approbationem divinam mediantibus apostolis ad
catholicos pervenerunt, quia Christus, dum viveret in
carne mortali cum apostolis, multa docuit eos et fecit
coram eis quae tamen in biblia non habentur. Ex
revelatione etiam Spiritus Sancti, qui secundum
promissionem Christi docturus erat apostolos omnem
veritatem, multa quae non habentur in sacris literis
didicerunt quae postea catholicos docuerunt. Omnes
veritates praedictas et quae ex eis consequentia
necessaria omni tempore necessitatem habente possunt
inferri dicunt isti catholicas esse tenendas.

[3] Some truths of this kind are also preserved outside
the canon and yet have become known to catholics by
divine revelation or approval through the mediation of
the apostles, because while he was living with the
apostles in mortal flesh Christ taught them many
things and did many things in their presence which are
nevertheless not found in the bible. By the revelation
of the Holy Spirit, who according to Christ's promise
was going to teach them all truth, the apostles also
learnt many things not found in the sacred scriptures
and afterwards they taught them to catholics. They say
that all the above truths and those that can be inferred
from them by an inference having necessity at every
time should be held to be catholic.

Praeter veritates vero praedictas dicunt esse quasdam
alias veritates quae ex solis contentis in Scriptura
Divina et veritatibus quae ad nos per apostolos
pervenerunt concludi non possunt, quae tamen ex
praedictis veritatibus vel aliqua earum et quibusdam
aliis veris quae in facto consistunt quae vere negari non
possunt manifeste sequuntur. Et de talibus veritatibus
exemplificare nituntur dicentes quod talis veritas est
ista: regulae a sanctis patribus, scilicet Basilio,
Benedicto, Augustino, et Francisco, institutae sunt
licitae, meritoriae, et perfectae, quia licet ista veritas ex
solis contentis in Scriptura Sacra et veritatibus quas ab
apostolis ecclesia universalis accepit inferri non possit,
cum de istis sanctis et gestis ac regulis institutis ab eis
nulla in praedictis veritatibus mentio habeatur, ista
tamen veritas simul ex Scripturis Divinis ac gestis et
actibus praedictorum sanctorum, de quibus gestis et
actibus christiano rationali sufficienter potest fieri
fides, concluditur evidenter. Tales etiam veritates sunt
istae: fides quam tenuit Augustinus est catholica
reputanda; symbolum Athanasii est catholicum et
fidele; sancta quatuor concilia generalia rite celebrata
veritatem catholicam diffinierunt; et huiusmodi multae
quae ex solis contentis in scriptura Divina Scriptura et
doctrina apostolica inferri non possunt, cum
Augustinus et Athanasius tunc non fuerint in rerum
natura nec tunc illa concilia fuerint celebrata, ex
contentis tamen in illis et aliis veris possunt concludi
patenter. Tales veritates dicunt esse quamplurimas,
quarum aliquae doctrinis autenticis sunt insertae,
nonnullae vero in scriptis non habentur. Istas veritates
non dicunt esse catholicas accipiendo vocabulum
catholici stricte sed dicunt eas sapere catholicam
veritatem, quia videlicet ex veritate catholica, stricte
accipiendo catholicam veritatem, et veris aliis
inferuntur. Et ideo dicunt quod large accipiendo
veritates catholicas possunt veritates catholicae

Now in addition to the above truths they say that there
are certain other truths which can not be inferred
solely from what is contained in divine scripture and
from the truths which have come to us through the
apostles, yet which clearly follow from the above
truths or from any one of them and certain other
truths of fact which can not truly be denied. And they
try to cite an example of such truths, saying that the
following is such a truth: the rules established by the
holy fathers, that is Basil, Benedict, Augustine, and
Francis, are licit, meritorious, and perfect, because,
although that truth can not be inferred solely from
what is contained in holy scripture and from the truths
which the universal church received from the apostles,
since those saints and their deeds and the rules
instituted by them are not mentioned among the
aforesaid truths, yet that truth is inferred manifestly
from the divine scriptures together with the deeds and
acts of the aforesaid saints, deeds and acts in which
trust can be established adequately for a reasonable
christian. The following are also truths of this kind:
the faith which Augustine held should be regarded as
catholic; the Athanasian creed is catholic and sure; the
four holy general councils properly celebrated defined
catholic truth; and many [truths] of this kind which
can not be inferred solely from what is contained in
divine scripture and from apostolic teaching, since
Augustine and Athanasius were not at that time
among living creatures and those councils had not
been celebrated then, yet they can be clearly inferred
from things contained in them and other truths. They
say that there are very many such truths, some of
which have been inserted into authentic teachings,
while some are not found in writing. They do not say
that those truths are catholic, taking the word
"catholic" strictly, but they say that they smack of
catholic truth, because, that is, they are inferred from
