Discipulus Quid si nullus potest sibi patenter ostendere
quod talis articulus ad fidem pertinet christianam?

Student What if no one can show him clearly that
such an article pertains to christian faith?

Magister Dicunt quod quousque sibi fuerit evidenter
ostensum dictum articulum ad fidem pertinere
catholicam, sufficit sibi credere eum implicite, paratus
credere explicite cum sibi monstratum fuerit quod ad
fidem pertinet christianam.

Master They say that until it has been plainly shown
to him that the said article pertains to catholic faith, it
is enough for him to believe it implicitly, ready to
believe explicitly when it is shown to him that it
pertains to christian faith.

Discipulus Procede ad alias auctoritates.

Student Go on to the other texts.

Magister Ad capitulum Aperte respondent quod
loquitur de praedicante et titubante in fide quia dubitat
fidem christianam esse veram.

Master To the chapter Aperte [24, q. 1, col.980] they
reply that it is speaking about a preacher wavering in
the faith because he doubts that the christian faith is
true.

Ad verba Gratiani eodem modo respondent quod
loquitur de praedicante fidem esse falsam vel incertam
vel de pertinaci docente aliqua contra fidem. Non
autem loquitur de illo qui ex simplicitate vel ignorantia
docet aliqua quae fidei obviant orthodoxae.

They reply in the same way to Gratian's words, that he
is speaking about someone preaching that the faith is
false or uncertain or about someone pertinacious
teaching things contrary to the faith. He is not
speaking, however, about someone who out of
simplicity or ignorance teaches things which are
opposed to orthodox faith.

Ad rationem qua innuitur dicunt quod fides debet esse
firma in universali, ut cuilibet veritati catholicae
firmiter, hoc est per fidem firmam explicite vel
implicite, fidelis adhaereat, sed non est necesse quod
cuilibet adhaereat firmiter explicite. Et sic intelligendae
sunt auctoritates adductae de concilio generali et de
symbolo Athanasii. Dubitans autem in fide, hoc est
dubitans fidem esse veram, non habet fidem firmam. Et
sic loquitur Bernhardus. Et ideo non catholicus sed
haereticus est censendus. Dubitans autem de articulo
aliquo speciali habet fidem firmam quod tota fides
christiana est vera et certa. Habet etiam fidem firmam
implicitam de eodem articulo de quo dubitat. Et ideo
est catholicus licet de tali articulo non habeat fidem
firmam explicitam.

To the argument by which it is implied [that faith
ought to be firm] they say that faith in the whole
ought to be firm, so that a believer clings firmly to
every catholic truth, that is explicitly or implicitly,
with a firm faith, but it is not necessary that he
explicitly clings firmly to every one. And in this way
the texts adduced in connection with a general council
and the Athanasian creed should be understood.
Someone who doubts the faith, however, that is
doubts that the faith is true, does not have a firm faith.
And this is the way in which Bernard speaks. And
therefore such a person should be considered not a
catholic but a heretic. Someone doubting some
particular article, however, does have a firm faith that
the whole christian faith is true and certain. He also
has a firm implicit faith about the very article that he
doubts. And therefore he is catholic even if he does
not have a firm explicit faith about that particular
article.

Another objection to the proposed description of a heretic
Discipulus Adhuc ad unam instantiam quae totam
descriptionem haeretici memoratam videtur elidere
cupio responderi. Beatus enim Augustinus, ut habetur
24, q. 3, c. Haereticus diffinit haereticum in hunc
modum, "Haereticus est qui alicuius temporalis
commodi et maxime vanae gloriae principatusque sui
gratia falsas ac novas opiniones vel gignit vel
sequitur." Ex qua diffinitione colligitur quod qui

Student I want the reply to one further objection
which seems to shatter the whole preceding
description of a heretic. For as we find in 24, q. 3, c.
Haereticus [col.998], blessed Augustine defines a
heretic in this way, "A heretic is someone who either
generates or follows false and new opinions for the
sake of some temporal advantage and especially for
the sake of his own glory and rule." We gather from
