papa et etiam {*om. &NaPeRe} imperator
fuissent facti haeretici, Romani eo ipso
recuperassent ius eligendi et potestatem de
electoribus ordinandi.
Discipulus Istam opinionem volo quod
aliquantulum tractemus diffuse. Ideo antequam
alleges pro ipsa, ut magis addiscam
{*advertam &NaPeRe} an aliquid veritatis
contineat, opto ut aliqua circa ipsam declares.
Primo igitur dic quare {quando &Pe} innuit
opinio ista quod ius eligendi non revertitur ad
Romanos nisi Papa efficeretur {*efficiatur
&NaRe} haereticus. Videtur {*enim add.
&NaPeRe} quod si soli cardinales vel
{*omnes add. &NaMzPeRe} alii {om. &Pe}
electores - si alii essent - efficerentur haeretici
reverteretur {revertetur &Mz} ius eligendi ad
Romanos quia eo ipso quod cardinales
{Romani &Pe} vel alii electores {sive
cardinales add. &Pe} efficerentur haeretici
essent privati iure eligendi. Sed eo ipso quod
aliqui privantur electione sive potestate
eligendi ius eligendi devoluitur ad alios ad
quos spectat de iure. Ergo non oportet quod
{oportet quod om. &Pe} papa efficiatur
{efficitur &Pe} haereticus ad hoc quod ius
eligendi revertatur ad Romanos.

Student I want us to consider that opinion at
some length. So that I better perceive whether
it contains some truth, therefore, I want you,
before you bring forward arguments for it, to
make some things about it clear. First,
therefore, tell me why that opinion implies
that the right to elect does not revert to the
Romans unless the pope becomes a heretic.
For it seems that if the cardinals alone or all
the other electors --- if there were others --became heretics, the right to elect would
revert to the Romans because the cardinals or
other electors would be deprived of the right
to elect by virtue of the fact that they became
heretics. But by the fact that some are
deprived of the election or of the power to
elect, the right to elect devolves upon others
to whom it pertains by right. It is not
necessary, therefore, that the pope become a
heretic for the right to elect to revert to the
Romans.

Magister Ista opinio intelligit quod papa
superstite ius eligendi non revertitur ad
Romanos quamvis cardinales vel alii electores
- si essent alii, sicut aliquando {alii &Na}
fuerunt alii - efficerentur haeretici nisi etiam
papa efficeretur haereticus, quia licet
cardinales eo ipso quod efficerentur haeretici
essent privati iure eligendi tamen papa
catholicus superstes non esset propter hoc
{propter hoc om. &Pe} {propter hoc: papa
&Mz} privandus {*privatus &NaPeRe}
potestate ordinandi de electoribus. Sed si papa
esset mortuus, eo ipso quod cardinales
efficerentur haeretici, ius eligendi illa vice {illa
vice om. &Pe} reverteretur ad Romanos.

Master That opinion means that as long as
the pope survives, the right to elect does not
revert to the Romans even if the cardinals or
other electors --- if there were others, as there
sometimes have been --- were to become
heretics, unless the pope too were to become
a heretic, because although the cardinals
would be deprived of the right to elect by the
fact that they became heretics, yet the pope,
surviving as a catholic, would not for this
reason be deprived of the right to make
arrangements for electors. But if the pope
were dead, by the fact that the cardinals had
become heretics, the right to elect would on
that occasion revert to the Romans.

Discipulus Quare dicitur quod ius eligendi illa Student Why is it said that on that occasion
vice revertitur {*reverteretur &NaPeRe}
the right to elect would revert to the Romans?
