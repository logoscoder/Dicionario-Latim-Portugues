CHAPTER 18

Student After we have sought to learn by
way of discussion and recitation whether
it is appropriate for the world to be under
one emperor and by what virtues the
emperor of the world ought to be
distinguished, let us come to the Roman
empire, asking first from what the Roman
empire has come, whether, that is, it is
from men or from God.

WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE?

Magister Una est opinio quod imperium
{*romanum add. &MzNaRe} fuit a Deo {trs.312
&Pe} constitutum {*institutum
&MdMzNaPeRe} et non ab hominibus
{trs.23451 &Md}. Alia {secunda &Md} est quod
fuit {sit &Mz} primo constitutum {institutum
&Ly} a Deo et tamen per homines scilicet per
Romanos {*primo ... romanos: ex hominibus
scilicet a populo romano &NaRe} {primo ...
romanos: ab hominibus scilicet a papa romano
&Mz} {primo ... Romanos: ab hominibus et a
papa romano /add. institutum Pe\ &MdPePz}.
Tertia opinio {*om. &MdMzNaPeRe} est quod
verum imperium Romanum fuit a Papa. Dicunt
{dicit &Mz} enim quod Constantinus Magnus
postquam fuit conversus ad fidem catholicam
{om. &Pe} {*trs. &MzNaRe} illam inordinatam
potestatem qua {quae &Pe} forte {foret &NaRe}
[[?omission sign &Re]] {*foris &Mz} antea
allegative {*illegitime &MzNaPeRe} utebatur

Master One opinion is that the Roman
empire was established by God and not
by men. Another is that it was from men,
that is from the Roman people. A third is
that the true Roman empire was from the
pope. For they (the last group) [[or read
dicit with Mz]] say that after he was
converted to catholic faith Constantine
the Great humbly transferred to the
church, that is to the highest pontiff, that
irregular power which he was previously
wielding abroad illegitimately, and
received back again [[could intus be right,
parallel with earlier foris?]] from the
vicar of Christ, the successor that is of
blessed Peter, the ordinate power of
empire from heaven, which thereafter he
used legitimately to punish evildoers and
to praise the good, so that he who before
was abusing his permitted power was
then discharging the authority granted to
