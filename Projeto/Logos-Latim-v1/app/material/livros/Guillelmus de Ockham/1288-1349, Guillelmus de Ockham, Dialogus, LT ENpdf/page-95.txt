non ut secundum eorum, scilicet quod a seductis atque
in errorem lapsis parentibus errantes suam sententiam
perversam acceperint, necessario requiratur ad hoc
quod errantes de numero haereticorum minime sint
censendi; sed illud secundum ponit volens per ipsam
assignare unum modum probandi aliquos sententiam
suam falsam ex audacia suae praesumptionis minime
peperisse, quia si a parentibus suis vel aliis
quibuscunque sententiam suam falsam acceperunt
constat quod eam ex audacia suae praesumptionis
nullatenus pepererunt. Addit etiam illud secundum
volens innuere quod pluribus modis possunt errantes
errorem a suis accipientes parentibus se excusare quam
alii. Et ideo Augustinus non ponit ibi quinque sed
quatuor, per quorum quodlibet potest quis probari et
convinci haereticus. Et quod quatuor eis contraria
requiruntur ad hoc quod aliquis errans non sit inter
haereticos computandus. Cum autem dicis quod omnis
qui non accipit sententiam suam perversam ab alio
ipsam ex audacia suae praesumptionis parit et invenit,
respondent quod hoc non continet veritatem. Quidam
enim absque praesumptionis audacia ex ignorantia sola
errores a seipsis inveniunt; quia tamen non sunt
pertinaces inter haereticos minime numerantur.

things together not in the sense that the second of
them, namely that they have received their evil
opinion from parents led astray and fallen into error, is
necessarily required for errants not to be considered
among the number of the heretics; but he proposes
that second point because he wants to convey by
means of it one way of proving that some people did
not devise their false opinion out of the audacity of
their own presumption because, if they received their
false opinion from their parents or from any one else
at all, it is certain that they did not devise it out of the
audacity of their own presumption. He also adds that
second point because he wants to imply that those
errants who have received their faith from their
parents can excuse themselves in more ways than
others can. And so Augustine does not propose five
points there but four, through any one of which
someone can be proved and convicted as a heretic;
and [he proposes] that the four points opposed to them
are required for anyone erring not to be counted
among the heretics. When you say, however, that
everyone who does not receive his evil opinion from
someone else devises and discovers it out of the
audacity of his own presumption, they reply that this
does not contain the truth. For some people discover
errors by themselves out of ignorance alone without
the audacity of presumption; nevertheless because
they are not pertinacious, they are not numbered
among the heretics.

Discipulus Expone quomodo declarant tertium quod
ponit Augustinus.

Student Explain how they make clear the third point
that Augustine proposes.

Magister Secundum eos Augustinus intendit quod ad
hoc quod aliquis errans contra fidem non sit haereticus
requiritur quod quaerat cauta sollicitudine veritatem.
Non est autem intelligendum oportere errantem omni
tempore cauta sollicitudine quaerere veritatem si velit
catholicus reputari; sed tunc oportet eum cauta
sollicitudine quaerere veritatem, si cupit a numero
haereticorum excludi, quando sibi a catholicis cum
debitis circumstantiis nunciatur quod errat contra
catholicam veritatem et ipse non habet impedimentum
legitimum quare tunc non possit vel non debeat
quaerere veritatem. Alias enim haberetur contra ipsum
praesumptio violenta quod non ex simplicitate vel
ignorantia sed ex pertinacia suo adhaereret errori.

Master According to them Augustine means that for
someone erring against the faith not to be a heretic he
is required to seek the truth with diligent care. It
should not be understood [as meaning], however, that
it is necessary for someone erring to seek the truth all
the time with careful diligence; but if he wants to be
excluded from the number of the heretics, it is
necessary for him to seek the truth with careful
diligence at that time when it is announced to him
under appropriate circumstances by catholics that he
is erring against catholic truth and when there is no
legitimate hindrance because of which he can not and
ought not at that time seek the truth. Otherwise a
violent presumption would be held against him that he
was adhering to his error not out of simplicity or
ignorance but out of pertinacity.

Discipulus Dic de quarto.

Student Tell me about [Augustine's] fourth [point].

Magister Quartum quod et sufficit ad hoc ut errans
non sit hereticorum numero aggregandus est quod
paratus sit corrigi cum invenerit veritatem. Qui enim
non est paratus corrigi cum invenerit veritatem pertinax
et per consequens haereticus est censendus.

Master The fourth, which also suffices for an errant
not to be added to the number of the heretics, is that
he be ready to be corrected when he discovers the
truth. For he who is not ready to be corrected when he
discovers the truth should be considered pertinacious
