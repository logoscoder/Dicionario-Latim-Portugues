acquiescere eorum sententiae; sed unus etiam inferior
papa potest contradicere omnibus aliis in generali
concilio congregatis; ergo non tenetur acquiescere
eorum sententiae. Ergo multo magis papa si omnium
aliorum in generali concilio existentium videret
erroneam esse sententiam vel non intelligeret eam esse
catholicam atque sanam eos sequi non deberet. Maior
est manifesta. Minor ostenditur exemplo Pannutii qui
aliis in Nicena synodo contradixit et ad partem suam
traxit, ut habetur dist. 31, c. Nicena synodus. Ubi
glossa super verbo "sententiam" ait, "Unus ergo potest
contradicere toti universitati si habeat causam
rationabilem." Et sequitur: "Nam unus potest trahere
alios ad partem suam." Unus igitur potest omnibus aliis
in concilio generali contradicere et eos trahere ad
partem suam. Ergo papa non debet omnes alios sequi
nisi cognoverit eos a iustitia et veritate nullatenus
aberrare. Ex praedictis concludunt isti quod si papa
omnes alios in generali concilio congregatos sequi non
debet ut aliquam assertionem condemnet tanquam
haereticam nisi viderit quomodo dicta assertio
catholicae veritati obviat, multo magis si papa
cognoverit aliquos theologos aliquam assertionem
reputare catholicam non debet propter informationem
vel instantiam omnium aliorum talem assertionem
tanquam haereticam condemnare nisi aperte cognoverit
quomodo fidei obviat orthodoxae.

bound to agree with their opinion; but one man, even
someone inferior to the pope, can contradict everyone
else gathered in a general council; therefore he is not
bound to agree with their opinion. Much more is it the
case, therefore, that if a pope were to see that an
opinion of everyone else in a general council was
wrong or were not to understand that it is catholic and
sound he should not follow them. The major premise
is obvious. The minor [premise] is shown by the
example of Pannutius who contradicted the others at
the synod of Nicea and led them to his side, as we find
in dist. 31, c. Nicena synodus [col.114]. The gloss
here on the word "sentence" says [col.153],
"Therefore one man can contradict the whole
collectivity if he has a reasonable cause.... For one
person can lead others to his side." Therefore one man
can contradict all the others in a general council and
lead them to his side. A pope should not follow all the
others, therefore, unless he knows that they have not
strayed from justice and truth. They conclude from the
above that if the pope should not follow all the others
gathered in a general council in condemning some
assertion as heretical unless he sees how the said
assertion is opposed to catholic truth, much more is it
the case that he should not, if he knows that some
theologians regard some assertion as catholic,
condemn such an assertion as heretical because of the
instruction or insistence of all the others unless he
knows clearly how it is opposed to orthodox faith.

Discipulus Rationes praedictae videntur difficiles ad
solvendum, quas tamen nolo nunc amplius pertractari
quia postquam totum praesens opus compleveris et ego
cum summo studio cogitavero volo tecum istas rationes
et omnia alia retractare et mentem tuam de omnibus
perscrutari. Sed dic an isti sentiant quod liceat papae
aliquam assertionem de qua non constat sibi an
catholica vel haeretica sit censenda interdicere et
praecipere quod minime publice dogmatizetur.

Student The above arguments seem difficult to refute,
but I do not want them to be investigated any further
now because after you have completed the whole of
this present work and I have pondered it with the
greatest zeal I want to reconsider with you those
arguments and everything else and to investigate your
understanding of all those matters. But tell me
whether they think that it is permissible for the pope
to forbid some assertion about which it is not evident
to him whether it should be considered catholic or
heretical and to order that it not be publicly taught as
doctrine.

Magister Dicunt quod in casu si ex dogmatisatione
alicuius assertionis magnum scandalum esset exortum
vel timeretur quod multitudo pertinaciter adhaereret
liceret papae praecipere a tali assertione cessare
quousque innotesceret an inter veritates vel haereses
computari deberet.

Master They say that in a particular case, if a great
scandal had arisen from the teaching of some assertion
as doctrine or if it were feared that a large number of
people would cling to it pertinaciously, it would be
permissible for the pope to order the cessation of such
an assertion until such time as it were to become
known whether it should be reckoned as among the
truths or the heresies.
