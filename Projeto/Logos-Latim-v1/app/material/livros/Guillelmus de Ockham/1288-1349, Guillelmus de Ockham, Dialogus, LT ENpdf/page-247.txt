potestatibus secularibus falsitate dampnatis heretica, de
lapidibus, id est de laicis et abiectis pauperibus et
despectis, catholicos Dei filios suscitare. Sicut enim in
idiotis et laicis, sacerdotibus et religiosis ac
magistratibus repudiatis, fidem primitus fundavit
catholicam, ita, omnibus literatis et potentibus datis in

is from laypeople and abject and despised paupers, if
all those gathered together at a general council fall
into heresy, indeed if all the clergy of the world and
those powerful in secular affairs are condemned for
heretical falsity. For just as he [God] first founded the
catholic faith on unlearned laypeople, having rejected
priests, religious people and magistrates, so if all the
learned and powerful fall into a false understanding
he can provide paupers, the simple, the unlearned and
rustics for the building up of the orthodox church.

Capitulum 29

Chapter 29

Discipulus Admiracione promoveor quod isti
presumunt asserere totum clerum posse falsitate
heretica irretiri. Et quia vix umquam aliquis absque
motivo assentit errori, aperias unde isti moventur pro
opinione predicta?

Student: I am moved to astonishment that they
presume to affirm that all the clergy can be ensnared
by heretical falsity. And because scarcely ever does
anyone assent to an error without reason, would you
reveal by what they are moved in favour of that
opinion?

That all the clergy can err
Magister Principale motivum eorum est hoc, quod sepe
pro multis assercionibus est inductum, quod una sola
videlicet est ecclesia militans que contra fidem errare
non potest. Constat autem quod congregacio fidelium
que clericos et laicos comprehendit de facto, vel
comprehendere potest, nequit contra fidem errare.
Multitudo autem tota clericorum non est illa
congregacio, licet sit pars eius, quemadmodum et
multitudo laicorum est pars eius. Ergo tota multitudo
clericorum potest contra fidem errare.

Master: Their main reason is this one, which has
often been brought forward for many assertions,
namely that there is only one church militant which
can not err against faith. It is certain, however, that
the congregation of believers which consists in fact,
or can consist, of the clergy and the laity can not err
against faith. The whole multitude of the clergy,
however, is not that congregation, although it is part
of it, just as the whole multitude of the laity is also
part of it. Therefore the whole multitude of the clergy
can err against faith.

Discipulus Habentne alia fundamenta minus principalia
pro assercione predicta?

Student: Do they have any less important bases for
that assertion?

Magister Aliis racionibus pluribus se fundare nituntur.
Unde secundum motivum eorum est hoc: tota illa
particularis multitudo Christianorum qui in omnibus
locis ponunt scandalum fidei orthodoxe et qui soli
scindunt ecclesiam et populos de domo Dei seducunt
potest contra fidem errare. Huiusmodi est multitudo
clericorum, teste beato Hieronimo, qui, ut recitatur 24,
q. 3, c. Transferunt, ait, "Veteres scrutans historias,
invenire non possum scidisse ecclesiam et de domo
Domini populos seduxisse preter eos qui sacerdotes a
Deo positi fuerant et prophete, id est speculatores. Isti
ergo recurrunt in laqueum tortuosum in omnibus locis
ponentes scandalum." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi
quod sacerdotes et speculatores id est doctores
consueverunt ecclesiam Dei scindere et populos de
domo Dei seducere scandalum fidei catholice ubique
ponendo. Ergo omnes sacerdotes possunt contra fidem
errare. Nomine autem sacerdotis intelliguntur clerici
inferiores, secundum quod notat glossa Extra, De

Master: They try to establish it with many other
arguments. Thus their second reason is this. That
whole particular multitude of Christians who in all
places create a scandal for orthodox faith and who
alone divide the church and lead people away from
the house of God can err against faith. The multitude
of the clergy is like that as blessed Jerome attests. As
we find in 24, q. 3, c. Transferunt, he says [col.999],
"Examining old histories thoroughly, I can not find
that the church was divided and the people led away
from the house of the Lord except by those who had
been appointed priests by God and by prophets, that
is investigators. Therefore they return to that
complicated trap, placing a stumbling block in all
places." We are given to understand by these words
that priests and investigators, that is doctors, have
been accustomed to divide the church of God and to
lead people away from the house of God by placing a
stumbling block for the catholic faith everywhere.
