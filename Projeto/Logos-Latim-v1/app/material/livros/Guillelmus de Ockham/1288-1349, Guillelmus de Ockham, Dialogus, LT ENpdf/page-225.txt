future.
Discipulus Hii errant aperte, quia, sicut allegasti prius,
beatus Hieronimus loquitur de futuro, dicens beato
Petro opem ferente in futuro seculo permanebit sine ulla
hereticorum insultacione.

Student: These people are obviously wrong because,
as you argued earlier, bessed Jerome is speaking of
the future when he says that with blessed Peter
bringing it help [the Roman church] in future ages
will remain free from the insolence of heretics.

Magister Dicunt te decipi per sermonem ambiguum
cuius sensus nescis distinguere. Verba enim beati
Hieronimi secundum unum sensum equivalent
condicionali tali: si beatus Petrus opem feret in futuro
seculo permanebit etc. Et iste sensus est verus, licet
temerarium sit asserere quod beatus Petrus opem feret,
quia nescitur an Deus et similiter beatus Petrus deseret
Romanam ecclesiam, quemadmodum a multis
temporibus deseruit ecclesiam Anciochenam. Alius
sensus equivalet causali tali: quia beatus Petrus opem
feret in futuro seculo permanebit etc., et sic non
intellexit Ieronimus. Tercius sensus est temporalis talis:
dum beatus Petrus opem feret etc., et iste eciam sensus
est verus. Sed nescitur quanto tempore beatus Petrus
opem feret Romane ecclesie contra insultacionem
hereticorum. Et ideo temerarium est asserere quod
usque ad finem seculi opem feret ecclesie Romane que
est pars ecclesie universalis contra hereticos.

Master: They say that you are deceived by an
ambiguous word the senses of which you are unable
distinguish. For in one sense the words of blessed
Jerome are equivalent to the following conditional, if
blessed Peter brings it help [the Roman church] in
future ages will remain etc, and that sense is true,
although it is rash to assert that blessed Peter will
bring help because it is not known whether God, and
likewise blessed Peter, will abandon the Roman
church, just as he abandoned the church of Antioch a
long time ago. Another sense is equivalent to the
following causal [statement], because blessed Peter
will bring help, [the Roman church] in future ages
will remain etc, and Jerome did not mean it in that
sense. A third sense is the following temporal
[statement], when blessed Peter brings help etc., and
that sense is also true. But it is not known for how
long a time blessed Peter will bring help to the
Roman church against the insolence of heretics. And
it is rash to assert, therefore, that until the end of the
age he will bring help against heretics to the Roman
church which is part of the universal church.

Capitulum 23

Chapter 23

Discipulus Vellem scire an isti aliis racionibus satagant
se munire.

Student: I would like to know whether they try to
defend themselves with other arguments.

Magister Pluribus aliis racionibus suam assercionem
fulcire nituntur. Unde secunda racio eorum talis est.
Omnis ecclesia que incepit post ascensionem Christi
potest contra fidem errare, quia illa ecclesia quam
predixit Christus in fide usque ad finem seculi
permansuram fuit etiam pro sui parte ante ascensionem
Christi. Christus enim, predicens ecclesiam suam usque
ad finem seculi mansuram in fide cum dixit Matthei
ultimo, "Vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad
consummacionem seculi", non solum intelligebat de
ecclesia futura post suam ascensionem, sed intelligebat
quod nullo tempore, nec ante ascensionem nec post, erat
tota ecclesia Christianorum a fide catholica recessura.
Non ergo intellexit de ecclesia que incepit post
ascensionem; sed ecclesia Romana incepit post
ascensionem Domini, quia apostoli et alii discipuli
Christi post ascensionem prius predicaverunt in aliis
locis quam Rome. Ergo verba Christi de ecclesia in fide
usque ad finem seculi permansura non debent de
ecclesia Romana determinate intelligi, sed sub
disiunccione et in communi de Romana ecclesia et aliis

Master: They try to fortify their assertion with many
other arguments. Thus their second argument, for
example, is the following. Every church which began
after Christ's ascension can err against faith because
that church which Christ predicted would continue in
faith until the end of the age also existed
independently before Christ's ascension. For when, in
predicting that his church would continue in faith to
the end of the age, Christ said in the last chapter of
Matthew [28:20], "I am with you always till the end
of the age", he did not mean only the future church
after his ascension but also meant that at no time,
either before or after his ascension, would the whole
church of Christians withdraw from catholic faith.
Therefore he did not mean a church that began after
the ascension. But the Roman church began after the
Lord's ascension because the apostles and other
disciples preached in other places before Rome after
Christ's ascension. Therefore Christ's words about the
church's remaining in faith until the end of the age
should not be understood specifically of the Roman
