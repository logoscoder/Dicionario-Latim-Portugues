consequens non tenetur eos in eadem sententia sequi.
Maior istius rationis est omni catholico manifesta.
Minor auctoritate ipsius Christi probatur qui, ut legitur
Iohannis 15, loquens de Iudaeis ait, "Si opera non
fecissem in eis, quae nemo alius fecit, peccatum non
haberent," mihi scilicet non credendo. "Nunc autem et
viderunt," miracula manifesta quae feci, "et oderunt me
et patrem meum." Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod si
Christus miracula non fecisset Iudaei non credendo
peccatum minime habuissent.

consequently he is not bound to follow them in that
opinion. The major [premise] of this argument is
obvious to any catholic. The minor [premise] is
proved by the authority of Christ himself, who,
speaking of the Jews, says, as we read in John 15[:24],
"If I had not done among them works that no other
man hath done, they would not have sin," in not
believing me, that is; "But now they have both seen"
the obvious miracles that I performed, "and hated both
me and my father." We gather from these words that if
Christ had not performed miracles, the Jews would
not have had sin in not believing.

Discipulus Si ista ratio concluderet sequeretur quod
toti ecclesiae universali fides minime esset adhibenda.
Immo posset aliquis absque peccato assertionem quam
hactenus praedicavit universalis ecclesia si non videret
quomodo esset consona Scripturae Divinae negare,
cum tota congregatio quorumcunque mortalium non sit
tantae auctoritatis quantae solus Christus. Et ita si
Christo non fuit credendum absque miraculo nec toti
ecclesiae est credendum nisi sententia ecclesiae aperto
miraculo confirmetur.

Student If that argument were conclusive it would
follow that faith would not have to be put in the whole
universal church. Indeed anyone could without sin
deny an assertion which the universal church has
hitherto preached if he did not see how it was in
harmony with divine scripture, since the whole
gathering of any mortals at all is not of such great
authority as is Christ alone. And so if Christ did not
have to be believed without a miracle nor should the
whole church be believed unless the opinion of the
church is confirmed by an obvious miracle.

Magister Ad istam obiectionem tuam dicerent illi qui
praedictam tenent sententiam quod adhaerendo
sententiae universalis ecclesiae nemine discrepante,
quando eadem sententia aliquo miraculo minime
confirmatur, principaliter creditur Christo cuius
doctrina tota est miraculis innumeris confirmata.
Invenitur enim expresse quod Christus promisit fidem
suam usque ad finem saeculi duraturam. Ex quo
sequitur quod nunquam ecclesia universalis errabit
contra veritatem catholicam. Quare si ecclesia
universalis nemine discrepante docet aliquid esse
tenendum tamquam catholicum, hoc firmiter est
tenendum propter auctoritatem Christi et non
principaliter propter auctoritatem ecclesiae, licet
quodammodo etiam propter auctoritatem ecclesiae sit
tenendum, inquantum firma fide tenetur quod Christus
docuit ecclesiam nunquam a fide catholica recessuram.

Master Those who hold the above opinion would say
to that objection of yours that to adhere to an opinion
of the universal church with which no one disagreed,
when that opinion is not confirmed by some miracle,
is to place one's chief faith in Christ whose teaching
has been confirmed by innumerable miracles. For we
find expressly that Christ promised that his faith
would last till the end of the age. It follows from this
that the universal church will never err against
catholic truth. Therefore if the universal church, with
no one disagreeing, teaches that something should be
held as catholic, it should be held firmly because of
Christ's authority and not chiefly because of the
church's authority, although it should in some way
also be held because of the church's authority, in so
far as it is held with firm faith that Christ taught that
the church would never fall away from the catholic
faith.

Discipulus Hic possem quaerere multa de ecclesia
quae errare non potest et de concilio generali, sed illa
omnia duxi ad tempus aliud differenda. Et ideo ad
principale propositum revertaris et rationes compleas
in quibus potest praedicta sententia se fundare?

Student I could ask many things here about the
church that can not err and about a general council,
but I have considered that all those things should be
postponed to another time. Would you return to the
main plan, therefore, and complete the arguments on
which the above opinion can base itself?

Magister Secunda ratio pro praedicta opinione est
haec. Qui non propter miraculum aliquod nec propter
auctoritatem Scripturae Divinae nec propter aliquam
aliam auctoritatem quam videat sed ad instantiam
hominum aliquam assertionem damnat solenniter
eandem damnationem in sapientia aut voluntate

Master A second argument for that opinion is this.
He who solemnly condemns some assertion not
because of some miracle or the authority of divine
scripture or some other authority that he sees but at
the insistence of men seems to base that condemnation
on the wisdom, will or insistence of men. The
