add. &MdPe} potestatem ordinatam a Deo et ita
habuerunt veram potestatem temporalem.
Item 1 {2 &Md} ad Corinthios 7:[20-1] ait
apostolus, "Unusquisque in qua {om. &Md}
{eadem &Pe} vocatione {in qua add. &MdPe}
vocatus est, {trs. &Md} in ea permaneat
{permaneant &Pe}. Servus vocatus es? Non sit
tibi cure." Ante vocationem ergo {igitur &Md}
ad fidem est aliquis servus, et per consequens
aliquis {*alius &NaPeRe} {om. &Pz} est
{*verus add. &MdMzNaPeRe} dominus eius.

Again, at 1 Corinthians 7:20-1 the apostle
says, "Let each of you remain in the
condition in which you were called. Were
you a slave when called? Do not be
concerned about it." Someone is a slave,
therefore, before his call to the faith, and,
as a consequence, someone else is his true
lord.

Item {*1 add. &MdMzNaPeRe} ad Timotheum
6:[1-2] {*dicit apostolus add. &MzNaRe},
"Quicunque sunt {sint &Pe} sub iugo servi
dominos suos omni {cum &Na} honore dignos
arbitrentur, {arbitrantur &MdPe} ne nomen
Domini et doctrina blasphemetur. Qui autem
fideles habent {sunt &Md} dominos, non
contemnant quia sunt fratres sed magis serviant
quia fideles." Ubi apostolus inter servos habentes
dominos infideles {fideles &MdPe} {*et servos
habentes dominos fideles /infideles &MdNaPe\
add. &MdMzNaPeRe} videtur distinguere et
dominos fideles et servos habentes dominos
{*fideles et servos habentes dominos om.
&MdNaPeRe} infideles {et servos habentes
dominos infideles om. &Mz} praecipit honorari.
Quod minime faceret nisi aliqui infideles essent
vere {*veri &MdMz} domini.

Again, the apostle says at 1 Timothy 6:12, "Let all who are under the yoke of
slavery regard their masters as worthy of
all honour, so that the name of God and
the teaching may not be blasphemed.
Those who have believing masters must
not be disrespectful to them on the ground
that they are brethren but rather must
serve them all the more as believers."
Here the apostle seems to distinguish
between slaves having unbelieving
masters and slaves having believing
masters, and he orders unbelieving
masters to be honoured. He would not do
this unless some unbelieving masters
were true masters.

Item beatus Paulus asseruit se esse {om. &Pe}
civem Romanum, sicut patet {om. &Md}
Actuum 16:[37] et 22:[25-7]. Non fuit autem
civis Romanus nisi auctoritate et concessione
Romanorum cum etiam tunc non fuisset Romae.
Ergo {igitur &Md} Romani habuerunt veram
potestatem qua poterant aliis civilitatem
{civitatem &Re} Romanam concedere.

Again, blessed Paul asserts that he is a
Roman citizen, as is clear in Acts 16:37
and 22:25-7. But he was not a Roman
citizen except by the authority and grant
of the Romans, since also he was not then
at Rome. Therefore the Romans had true
power by which they could grant Roman
citizenship to others.

Item ut {om. &Na} legitur Actuum 24:[10]
Paulus dicit {*dixit &MdMzNaRe} {om. &Pe}

Again, as we read in Acts 24:10, blessed
Paul said to the pagan Lisias [actually
