Discipulus Ex quo intelligo quae est correctio
sufficiens et legitima reputanda secundum multos, et
distinctionem de corripiente errantem considero. Cupio
scire an omnes sentiant literati quod errans, correctus a
praelato suo vel habente iurisdictionem super ipsum,
teneatur suum errorem revocare, licet non fuerit sibi
patenter ostensum per eundem quod error suus
catholicae obviat veritati, utrum scilicet ad solam
admonitionem vel increpationem praelati sui errorem
suum debeat revocare.

Student From this I understand what, according to
many, should be regarded as sufficient and legitimate
correction, and I am thinking about a distinction
concerning one who corrects someone erring. I want
to know whether all the learned believe that someone
erring, who has been corrected by his prelate or
someone having jurisdiction over him, is bound to
retract his error, even if it has not been clearly shown
to him by that person that his error conflicts with
catholic truth, whether, that is, he ought to retract his
error solely on the advice or rebuke of his prelate.

Magister De hoc diversi diversimode opinantur. Dicunt
enim nonnulli quod nullus correctus a praelato vel
iurisdictionem habente tenetur errorem revocare
antequam fuerit sibi patenter ostensum modo praedicto
quod error suus est contrarius veritati.

Master On this question different people have
different views. For some say that no one corrected
by a prelate or one having authority over him is
bound to retract his error before it has been clearly
shown to him in the aforesaid way that his error is
contrary to the truth.

Hoc probant primo sic. Illi qui in expositione Scripturae
Divinae et per consequens in traditione eorum quae ad
fidem pertinent orthodoxam praeferuntur praelatis et
iurisdictionem habentibus non tenentur nec debent, si
erraverint ignoranter, opiniones suas tanquam
haereticas, licet sint in rei veritate erroneae, revocare,
quamvis correcti fuerint a praelatis vel aliis, nisi eis
fuerit patenter ostensum quod opiniones suae veritati
obviant orthodoxae, quia qui maioris auctoritatis est in
aliquo nequaquam in hoc minori subicitur.

They prove this first as follows: those who, in the
exposition of divine scripture, and consequently in the
passing on of those matters that pertain to orthodox
faith, are preferred to prelates and those having
jurisdiction, are not bound and ought not, if they have
erred unknowingly, to retract their opinions as
heretical -- although they may in point of fact be
erroneous -- even if they have been corrected by
prelates or others, unless it has been clearly shown to
them that their opinions conflict with orthodox truth.
This is because whoever is of greater authority in
some matter is not subjected in this matter to one of
lesser authority.

Ergo qui praeferuntur praelatis in expositione
Scripturae Divinae non subiciuntur eis in hoc; sed
doctores et tractatores Scripturae Divinae praeferuntur
praelatis et iurisdictionem habentibus in expositione
Scripturae Divinae, et per consequens in traditione
illorum quae ad fidem pertinent orthodoxam; ergo
doctores non tenentur opiniones suas, licet sint
erroneae, revocare si fuerint a correcti praelatis, nisi
probatum eis fuerit evidenter quod eorum opiniones
obviant veritati.

Those who are preferred to prelates in the exposition
of divine scripture, therefore, are not subjected to
them in this; but doctors and commentators on divine
scripture are preferred, in the exposition of divine
scripture, and consequently in the handing down of
those matters that pertain to orthodox faith, to prelates
and those having jurisdiction. If doctors have been
corrected by their prelates, therefore, they are not
bound to renounce their opinions, even if they are
erroneous, unless it has been clearly proved to them
that their opinions conflict with the truth.

Maior est certa. Minor probatur primo auctoritate
Gratiani in decretis (dist. 20. para. 1) qui ait, "Aliud est
causis terminum imponere, aliud Scipturas Sacras
diligenter exponere." Et infra, "Apparet quod
Divinarum Scripturarum tractatores, et si scientia
pontificibus praemineant, tamen, quia dignitatis eorum
apicem non sunt adepti, in Sacrarum Scripturarum
expositionibus eis praeponuntur, in causis vero
diffiniendis secundum post eos locum merentur." Ex
quibus patenter habetur quod doctores in expositione
Scripturarum pontificibus praeferuntur.

The major [premise] is certain; the minor is proved
(a) in the first place on the authority of Gratian in the
decretals, dist. 20. para. 1 [really, para. 2; col.65]. He
says: "It is one thing to impose an end to cases, it is
another carefully to expound the holy scriptures."
And further on: "It is clear that commentators on the
divine scriptures, especially if they surpass pontiffs in
knowledge, are put before them in expositions of the
sacred scriptures, although they have not acquired
their high office. They rank second to them, however,
in defining cases." From these words we clearly find
that doctors are preferred to pontiffs in the exposition
