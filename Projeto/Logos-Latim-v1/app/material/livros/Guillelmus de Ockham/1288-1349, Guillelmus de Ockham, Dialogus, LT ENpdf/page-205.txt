Quarto sic: illa ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest a
qua quicumque dissentit non est inter episcopos
catholicos computandus, quia propter dissensionem ab
hereticis nemo est a catholicorum numero excludendus;
sed quicumque ab ecclesia Romana dissentit non est de
catholicis episcopis reputandus, teste beato Ambrosio
qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Advocavit, ait, "Advocavit ad
se Cyprianus episcopum Satirum, nec ullam putavit
veram nisi vere fidei graciam, percunctatusque est ex eo
utrumnam de catholicis episcopis esset, hoc est, si cum
Romana ecclesia conveniret." Ex quibus verbis datur
intelligi quod nemo potest esse de catholicis episcopis
nisi cum Romana ecclesia communicat. Ergo ecclesia
Romana contra fidem errare non potest.

Fourthly, [it is shown] as follows. That church from
which anyone who dissents should not be counted
among catholic bishops can not err against faith
because no one should be excluded from the number
of catholics because of a disagreement with heretics;
but whoever disagrees with the Roman church
should not be regarded as a catholic bishop, as
blessed Ambrose attests. As we find in 24, q. 1, c.
Advocavit, he says [col.974], "Cyprian summoned
Bishop Satirus; he did not think that any grace was
true except the grace of true faith and he questioned
him about whether he was among the catholic
bishops, that is whether he was in agreement with
the Roman church." We are given to understand by
these words that no one can be among catholic
bishops unless he is in communion with the Roman
church. Therefore the Roman church can not err
against faith.

Quinto sic: iIla ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest
extra quam nemo salvatur; sed extra Romanam
ecclesiam nemo salvari potest, teste beato Hieronimo
qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Quoniam vetus, loquens de
Romana ecclesia ait, "Ego nullum premium nisi
Christum sequens beatitudini tue, id est cathedre beati
Petri, communione Christi consocior. Super illam petram
fundatam ecclesiam scio. Quicumque extra hanc domum
agnum comederit prophanus est. Si quis in archa Noe
non fuerit peribit regnante diluvio." Et infra,
"Quicumque tecum non colligit dispergit." Ex quibus
verbis datur intelligi quod quicumque non fuerit per
conformitatem et unitatem fidei intra Romanam
ecclesiam de qua loquitur Hieronimus salvari nequit.
Ergo Romana ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest,
quia si erraret qui esset intra eam minime salvaretur.

[It is shown] fifthly as follows. That church outside
which no one is saved can not err against faith; but,
as blessed Jerome attests, no one can be saved
outside the Roman church. Speaking about the
Roman church he says, as we find in 24, q. 1, c.
Quoniam vetus [col.975], "Following no reward
except Christ I am joined by communion in Christ to
your blessedness, that is the church of blessed Peter.
I know that the church has been founded on that
rock. Whoever eats lamb outside this house is
impious. If anyone is not in Noah's ark he will
perish when the deluge rules ... Whoever does not
gather with you scatters." We are given to
understand by these words that whoever is not
through conformity and unity of faith within the
Roman church of which Jerome speaks can not be
saved. Therefore the Roman church can not err
against faith because if it were to err whoever was
within it would not be saved.

Sexto sic. Illa ecclesia non potest contra fidem errare a
qua omnis Christianus discedens est inter scismaticos
computandus; sed quicumque a Romana discedit ecclesia
inter scismaticos numeratur, quia extra ecclesiam
reputatur, teste Cypriano qui, ut legitur dist. 93, c. Qui
cathedram, ait, "Qui cathedram Petri, super quam
fundata est ecclesia, deserit in ecclesia se esse non
confidat." Et Innocencius 3, ut recitatur Extra De
maioritate et obediencia, omnes ab ovili Christi asserit
alienos, et per consequens scismaticos, "qui Petrum et
successores magistros non cognoscerent et pastores".
Ergo Romana ecclesia contra fidem errare non potest.

[It is shown] sixthly as follows. That church from
which any christian who withdraws should be
counted as among the schismatics can not err against
faith. But whoever withdraws from the Roman
church is numbered among the schismatics because,
as Cyprian attests, he is regarded as outside the
church. As we read in dist. 93, c. Qui cathedram, he
says [col.321], "He who abandons the see of Peter
upon which the church is founded is not assured of
being in the church." And as we find in Extra, De
maioritate et obediencia, [c. Solite; col.196]
Innocent III affirms that all those "who would not
recognise Peter and his successors as masters and
shepherds" are alien to Christ's sheepfold and
consequently are schismatic. Therefore the Roman
church can not err against faith.

Septimo sic: corpus sine membris non potest consistere;
