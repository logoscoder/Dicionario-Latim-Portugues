ignorance and are ready to be corrected.
Discipulus Quomodo respondetur ad illa per quae
probavi quod ignorantia non excusat?

Disciple How is reply made to those [arguments] by
which I proved that ignorance does not excuse?

Magister Ad primum dicitur quod ignorantia iuris est
duplex. Quaedam enim est ignorantia iuris quod
oportet scire, et illa non excusat; alia est ignorantia
iuris quod non oportet scire, et illa excusat a peccato,
licet forte in quibusdam aliis non excuset. Ille igitur
qui tenet haereses quarum contradictorias oportet eum
explicite credere non potest per ignorantiam excusari.
Et ideo quicunque inter christianos convenienter
enutritus teneret fidem christianam esse falsam vel
Christum non fuisse crucifixum vel non fuisse
incarnatum vel aliquid huiusmodi cuius nullus
Christianus debet esse ignarus non potest per
ignorantiam excusari, quia explicite tenetur credere
quod fides Christiana est vera et quod Christus fuit
crucifixus et huiusmodi quae facile est scire et inter
omnes catholicos divulgantur. Qui autem teneret
haereses quarum contradictorias non tenetur credere
explicite posset per ignorantiam excusari, dummodo
pertinaciam nullam adiungeret.

Master To the first it is said that ignorance of the law
is two-fold. For one ignorance is of a law which it is
necessary to know and that [ignorance] does not
excuse. Another ignorance is of a law which it is not
necessary to know, and that does excuse one of sin,
although in certain other cases it may not excuse. He
who holds heresies the contradictions of which it is
necessary for him explicitly to believe, therefore, can
not be excused by ignorance. Anyone brought up
suitably among christians, therefore, who might hold
that the christian faith is false or that Christ was not
crucified or was not made flesh or something of this
kind of which no christian ought to be ignorant can not
be excused by ignorance, because he is bound
explicitly to believe that the christian faith is true and
that Christ was crucified and things of this kind which
it is easy to know and which are published among all
catholics. He who might hold heresies the
contradictions of which he is not bound explicitly to
believe, however, could be excused by ignorance as
long as he did not add any pertinacity.

Ad secundum, de constitutione sedis apostolicae,
dicitur quod omnes astringit postquam est publice
divulgata ita quod nemo potest ignorantiam allegare.
Si autem non fuerit ita publice divulgata, non astringit
ignorantes qui non laborant ignorantia crassa et supina.
Quod ergo dicitur, quod omnes astringit post duos
menses, verum est omnes scientes et omnes ignorantes
damnabili ignorantia laborantes. Alios autem non
astringit ut facientes contrarium peccent coram Deo,
licet forte aliquando astringat eos ad poenam per
ecclesiam infligendam. Durum enim videtur nonnullis
dicere quod omnes Christiani tenentur scire omnes
decretales summorum pontificum, cum nonnulli
studentes in eis aliquando 20 annis et amplius multas
earum ignorent. Multi etiam ad earum copiam
nullatenus attingere possunt.

To the second, about a constitution of the apostolic
see, it is said that it does oblige everyone after it has
been so widely published that no one can claim
ignorance. If it has not been widely published in this
way, however, it does not oblige those who do not
know it, if they are not labouring under a crass and
lazy ignorance. The statement that it obliges everyone
after two months is true, therefore, of everyone who
knows it and everyone who does not know it because
of the burden of their reprehensible ignorance. It does
not oblige others, however, in such a way that those
acting contrary to it sin before God, though perhaps it
may sometimes bind them to a punishment to be
imposed by the church. For it seems hard to some to
say that all christians are bound to know all the
decretals of the highest pontiffs, when some people
who study them, sometimes for 20 years and more, do
not know many of them. Many can not even obtain a
copy of them at all.

Ad tertium dicunt quod etiam in his quae publice fiunt
contingit quandoque allegare ignorantiam, secundum
quod ex sacris canonibus 9. q. 1. c. Ordinationes et 1.
q. 1. c. Si qui a simoniacis et aliis aperte colligitur. Et
nonnunquam talem ignorantiam sufficit solo iuramento
probare. Et ita dicunt in proposito quod quamvis
quondam
fuerint
aliquae
haereses
publice
condemnatae, tamen possunt nunc etiam literati
ignorantiam allegare, dicentes se nescire tales haereses
fuisse damnatas. Et si petatur ab eis probatio quod

To your third they say that even in connection with
those things that are done publicly it is possible
sometimes to claim ignorance, according to what is
clearly gathered from the sacred canons, 9, q. 1, c.
Ordinationes [col.601; see especially gloss on nisi
probare, col.866], 1, q. 1, c. Si qui a simoniacis
[col.400] and others. Sometimes it is enough to prove
such ignorance by an oath alone. And so they say, on
the present topic, that even if some heresies have been
publicly condemned in the past, even the learned can,
