that whenever in the same community there
are many in charge, even holding the same
office or acting like one person, it is not best
regulated but falls short of the best
regulation, because the best regulation of a
community is that there be a single supreme
person in charge of it. It is often necessary
because of different occurrences, however, to
retreat from that best regulation, because
sometimes the subjects would not support
that single person, sometimes no one could
be found who alone would be adequate to
rule. So for many reasons it can happen that it
is better for many to rule than for one,
although a community would be better
regulated if one person could suitably be had
to be in charge, in the sense that any
community at all, especially a large one,
which is governed by many who are supreme
in the same community, is not governed
according to the best form of rule. [[mss seem
corrupt here and the addition of `quae' from
G seems a good solution.]] Yet, just as often
those who are in danger at sea are forced to
abandon the most direct route to sail in order
to avoid the dangers, and sometimes
travellers are forced to leave the best path and
to choose and longer and poorer one, and
frequently many good things are given up for
necessary reasons, and very often by way of
dispensation those who would at another time
be unworthy are promoted for a multiplicity
of reasons to different offices, so sometimes
it is necessary for a reasonable cause to
abandon the best way of ruling, namely the
rule of one person, and to accept the rule of
many.

Student That reply can be made to all the
arguments in the preceding chapter, in so far as
they prove that in a community of believers
there should not be many supreme judges,
that is an ecclesiastical and a secular one,
because they only prove, as that reply says,
that if a community of believers were to be
best regulated it ought to have supreme head
or judge. It is not necessary, however, that a
