multitudo virorum contra fidem errabit.

It is not affirmed without rashness, therefore, that the
whole multitude of men will never err against faith.

Discipulus Christus revelavit apostolis quod numquam
tota multitudo virorum errabit cum dicit Matthei ultimo,
"Ecce vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad
consummacionem seculi." Non dixit hoc eis pro ipsis
apostolis, quia ipsi erant ante finem seculi morituri.
Ergo dixit eis pro successoribus eorundem.

Student: Christ revealed to the apostles that the
whole multitude of men will never err when he says
in the last Chapter of Matthew [28:20], "And
remember, I am with you always, to the end of the
age." He did not say this to them in reference to the
apostles themselves because they would die before
the end of the age. Therefore he said it to them in
reference to their successors.

Magister Hoc non reputant isti concludere, quia
Christus verba predicta dixit apostolis pro fidelibus
credentibus et credituris in eum. Ita autem erant
mulieres crediture in ipsum sicut viri. Quare verba
Christi ad viros restringi non debent. Propter idem,
dicunt quod verba Christi cum dixit Petro, "Ego pro te
rogavi Petre ut non deficiat fides tua", ad viros sunt
minime coarctanda.

Master: They do not think that this is conclusive,
because Christ said those words to the apostles in
reference to the faithful who were believers and
would be believers in him. However women would
believe in him in this way just like men. Therefore
Christ's words should not be restricted to men. For
the same reason, they say that Christ's words when he
said to Peter [Luke 22:32], "I have prayed for thee
that thy faith fail not", should not be restricted to
men.

Chapter 33

Discipulus Non est aliquo modo credendum quod tota
multitudo virorum contra fidem errabit, sicut nec est
credendum quod infideles totam Christianitatem
occupabunt. Hoc enim Scripture Divine et verbis
videtur apertissime Christi obviare. Christus enim, ut
legitur Matthei 24, predicens destruccionem templi et
Iudaici populi que facta fuit postea per Titum et
Vespasianum dixit, "Erit enim tunc tribulacio magna,
qualis numquam fuit ab inicio mundi usque modo, nec
fiet, et nisi breviati fuissent dies illi, non fieret salva
omnis caro." Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod numquam
futura est tanta tribulacio quanta fuit facta per Romanos.
Si autem tota Christianitas, quantum ad viros,
destrueretur, multo maior esset tribulacio Christianorum
quam illa quam fecerunt Romani. Ergo numquam tota
multitudo virorum Christianorum destruetur, et per
consequens numquam errabit contra fidem.

Student: It should in no way be believed that the
whole multitude of men will err against faith, just as
it should not be believed that unbelievers will occupy
the whole of Christianity. For this seems very clearly
to conflict with divine scripture and the words of
Christ. For as we read in Matthew 24[:21-2], when
Christ foretold the destruction of the temple and the
Jewish people that was later carried out by Titus and
Vespasian he said, "For there shall be then great
tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning
of the world until now, neither shall be. And unless
those days had been shortened, no flesh should be
saved." We gather from these words that there will
never be as great a suffering as that caused by the
Romans. However if all the men of Christianity were
destroyed there would be a much greater suffering of
Christians than that which the Romans caused.
Therefore the whole multitude of Christian men will
never be destroyed and, as a consequence, will never
err against faith.

Item, maxima futura aversio Christianorum a fide erit
tempore Antichristi, sed tempore eius remanebunt
plures viri Christiani fideles, ipsa veritate attestante,
que, ut habetur Matthei 24 c., loquens de persecucione
futura tempore Antichristi, ait, "Surgent pseudo Christi
et pseudo prophete et dabunt signa magna et prodigia ita
ut in errorem inducantur, si fieri potest, etiam electi."
Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod tempore Antichristi
aliqui erunt sancti viri electi qui in errorem minime
inducentur. Quod beatus Iohannes in Apocalipsi in
diversis locis testari videtur.

Again, the greatest turning away from the faith by
Christians in the future will be in the time of antiChrist, but at that time many Christian men will
remain faithful, as the Truth himself attests. Speaking
about a future persecution at the time of anti-Christ
he says, as we find in Matthew 24[:24], 'For there
shall arise false Christs and false prophets and will
show great signs and wonders, in so much as to
deceive, if possible, even the elect." We gather from
these words that in the time of anti-Christ there will
be some elect holy men who will not be led into
