ruling the people subject to him justly and
beneficially. And therefore if he were to
command something which was contrary to
the benefit of the people subject to him, he
would not have to be obeyed. And hence it
is that the servants of the emperor and those
who are free are not bound to obey him
equally, but his servants are bound to obey
him in many matters in which the free are
not bound. For solely at the command of
the emperor his servants are bound to
abandon to him all the goods that they
possess without his alleging some common
benefit, but the free are not bound to this
and the emperor can not command it of
them without its being advantageous to the
common good, indeed without its being a
clear necessity. Servants of the emperor are
bound to obey him in many other matters as
well to which the free are not obligated. For
it would detract from the dignity of the
human race if all were servants of the
emperor, and it would detract in a similar
way, therefore, if the emperor could treat
the free like servants in everything. Since
the emperor is bound to make provision for
those things which pertain to the benefit
and dignity of the whole human race,
therefore, he should in no way wish to treat
the free as servants. The free are not bound,
therefore, to obey him in everything in
which his servants are bound to obey him.
