et ad beneplacitum instituto debet attribui quod contra
fidem errare non possit, quia aliquod collegium contra
fidem errare non posse aliter probari non potest nisi
quia Christus promisit fidelibus fidem catholicam usque
ad finem seculi duraturam. Verba autem Christi
promittentis fidem usque ad finem seculi permansuram
de nullo collegio particulari a summo pontifice instituto
debent intelligi, quia Christus promissionem suam in
ordinacione summi pontificis nequaquam instituit.
Collegium autem cardinalium est collegium particulare
a summo pontifice voluntarie et ad placitum institutum,
quia nec a Christo nec ab apostolis legitur institutum, eo
quod nec in Scriptura Sacra nec in gestis apostolorum
de cardinalibus aliqua mencio reperitur. Ergo
temerarium est dicere quod collegium cardinalium
numquam errabit contra fidem.

not be attributed to any particular college established
voluntarily and at his good pleasure by the highest
pontiff that it can not err against faith because that
some college can not err against faith can only be
proved because Christ promised believers that the
catholic faith would last to the end of the age.
However Christ's words promising that the faith
would remain to the end of the age should not be
understood of any particular college established by
the highest pontiff because Christ did not found his
promise on arrangements of the highest pontiff. The
college of cardinals, however, is a particular college
established voluntarily and at his pleasure by the
highest pontiff, since we do not read that it was
established by Christ or the apostles, in that we do
not find any mention of cardinals in sacred Scripture
or in the deeds of the apostles. It is rash to say,
therefore, that the college of cardinals will never err
against faith.

Secundo sic: illud collegium quod potest summus
pontifex destruere vel cassare non est illa ecclesia que
errare non potest, quia illa ecclesia que non potest errare
non potest esse nulla (24. q. 1. c. Pudenda), et per
consequens non potest a summo pontifice destrui et
cassari. Summus autem pontifex, sicut collegium
cardinalium instituit, ita posset idem collegium
destruere vel cassare, quia posset cardinalibus
morientibus alios minime subrogare; nec in hoc
diceretur precepti domini transgressor eo quod de
cardinalibus creandis nullum inveniatur preceptum
divinum. Ergo collegium cardinalium non est illa
ecclesia que contra fidem errare non potest.

Secondly [it is argued] as follows. That college
which the highest pontiff can destroy or make null is
not that church which can not err, because that
church which can not err can not be null (24, q. 1, c.
Pudenda; col.978]) and, consequently, can not be
destroyed and made null by the highest pontiff. Just
as the highest pontiff established the college of
cardinals, however, so he could destroy and make
null that same college because he could fail to
replace cardinals who died with others. In doing this
he would not be said to be a transgressor of a precept
of the Lord because we do not find any divine
precept about the need to create cardinals. Therefore
the college of cardinals is not that church which can
not err against faith. [Cf. Nicolas Minorita: Chronica
(ed. GÃ¡l and Flood, St Bonaventure, 1996), pp. 954,
primo.]

Tercio sic: illa ecclesia que contra fidem errare non
potest nequaquam post tempora apostolorum incepit,
quia ecclesie que erat temporibus apostolorum promisit
Christus se cum ea usque ad finem seculi permansurum
cum dixit Matthei ultimo, "Vobiscum sum omnibus
diebus usque ad consummacionem seculi." In quibus
verbis Christus innuit manifeste quod ab illo tempore
usque ad finem seculi nequaquam ecclesia a fide
catholica esset recessura, et ita illa ecclesia que errare
non potest post tempora apostolorum nequaquam
incepit. Collegium autem cardinalium post tempora
apostolorum incepit; ergo collegium cardinalium non
est illa ecclesia que errare non potest.

[It is argued] thirdly as follows. That church which
can not err against faith did not begin after the time
of the apostles because it was to the church which
existed in the time of the apostles that Christ made
the promise that he would remain with it until the end
of the age when he said in the last chapter of
Matthew [28:20], "I am with you always to the end
of the age." Christ clearly indicated by these words
that from that time to the end of the age the church
would not abandon the catholic faith, and so that
church which can not err did not begin after the time
of the apostles. The college of cardinals did begin
after the time of the apostles however. The college of
cardinals, therefore, is not that church which can not
err. [Cf. ibid., secundo.]

Quarto sic: illud collegium quod est inferius papa non
est illa ecclesia que contra fidem errare non potest, quia
sicut papa contra fidem potest errare ita omne collegium

[It is argued] fourthly thus. That college which is
inferior to the pope is not that church which can not
err against faith because, just as the pope can err
