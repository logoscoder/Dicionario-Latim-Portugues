errorem, ad confirmationem illius erroris nunquam fit
verum miraculum; sed si praedicant veritatem quamvis
sint mali fiunt aliquando miracula ad confirmationem
veritatis. Sic Iudas proditor quamvis fuerit malus quia
tamen docuit veritatem miracula faciebat. Quando ergo
fit miraculum verum ad assertionem aliquam
confirmandam tenendum est indubie quod talis assertio
pro vera debet haberi sive illi quibus revelata fuerit
inter bonos sive inter malos fuerint computandi.

some error a true miracle is never performed to
confirm it; but if they preach the truth they sometimes
perform miracles to confirm this truth even if they are
evil. So although the traitor Judas was evil he
nevertheless performed miracles because he taught the
truth. Therefore when a true miracle is performed to
confirm some assertion, it should be held without
doubt that such an assertion should be considered the
truth whether those to whom it was revealed should be
reckoned among the good or among the evil.

Discipulus Ista responsio est apparens. Unde quae
dixisti de ista secunda sententia sufficiant; sed si nosti
alios aliter dicere non differas indicare.

Student That reply is clear. Let what you have said
about that second opinion be enough, therefore; but do
not postpone making known to me if you know that
others say something else.

Magister Nonnulli putant quod tam concilium
generale quam etiam papa in damnando aliquam
assertionem tanquam haereticam in sola Scriptura
Sacra debet se fundare, quia solae veritates in Scriptura
Sacra contentae et quae sequuntur ex eis catholicae
sunt censendae. De hac sententia tractatus praecedens
te poterit informare.

Master Some people think that both a general council
and also a pope should base themselves on sacred
scripture alone when condemning some assertion as
heretical because only truths contained in sacred
scripture and those which follow from them should be
considered catholic. The preceding treatment can
inform you about this opinion.

Capitulum 28

Chapter 28

Discipulus Satis adverto ex praecedentibus quomodo
ista sententia fulciri poterit et quomodo etiam poterit
improbari, et ideo ad quaestionem aliam me converto.
Adhuc enim nescio an ad hoc quod catholici aliquam
assertionem habere debeant pro damnata explicite
oporteat in damnatione talem vel aequipollentem
modificationem
seu
specificationem
vel
determinationem tanquam haereticam vel contrariam
catholica veritati adiungere taliter vel aequipollenter
proferendo sententiam, "Talem assertionem tanquam
haereticam
vel
catholicae
veritati
inimicam
damnamus." Unde circa hoc unam vel plures narra
sententias.

Student I perceive sufficiently from what you have
said how that opinion can be strengthened and also
how it can be disproved, and so I turn to another
question. For I still do not know whether, in order for
catholics to have to consider some assertion as
explicitly condemned, it is necessary in the
condemnation to add this or some equivalent
modification, specification or determination of it as
"heretical" or "opposed to catholic truth", by
publishing a sentence like the following, or something
equivalent, "We condemn such an assertion as
heretical or as dangerous to catholic truth." Tell me
therefore one or more opinions about this.

Magister Ad hoc dupliciter respondetur. Quidam enim
dicunt quod talis determinatio vel modificatio seu
specificatio in sententia est ponenda ad hoc ut assertio
improbata pro haeresi damnata explicite habeatur, quia
dicunt quod assertio quae non est damnata tanquam
haeretica pro haeretica haberi non debet. Alii dicunt
quod ad hoc quod aliqua assertio pro haeretica
habeatur sufficit absque tali determinatione vocali
quod ipsa falsa assertio reprobetur vel veritas contraria
explicite approbetur et quod talis approbatio vel
reprobatio fundetur in catholica veritate. Sic Alexander
3 reprobans et interdicens ne aliquis dicat Christum
non esse aliquid secundum quod homo suam
reprobationem fundavit in veritate catholica ista,
videlicet Christus est verus Deus et verus homo. Et
ideo voluit quod dicta assertio pro haeretica haberetur
licet talem determinationem tanquam haereticam

Master This is replied to in two ways. For some
people say that such a determination, modification or
specification should be put in the sentence in order
that the rejected assertion be considered as an
explicitly condemned heresy, because they say that an
assertion that has not been condemned as heretical
should not be considered as heretical. Others say that
for some assertion to be considered as heretical it is
enough that the false assertion itself be rejected or its
opposing truth explicitly be approved without such a
determination in words and that such an approval or
rejection be based on catholic truth. So when
Alexander III forbad and rejected anyone's saying that
Christ is nothing as a man, he based his rejection on
this catholic truth, that Christ is true God and true
man. And therefore he wanted the said assertion to be
considered heretical, although in his prohibition he did
