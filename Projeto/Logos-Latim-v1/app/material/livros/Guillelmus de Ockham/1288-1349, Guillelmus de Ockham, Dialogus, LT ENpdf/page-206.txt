ecclesia autem fidelium est corpus Christi mysticum;
ergo ecclesia sine membris esse non potest. Membrum
autem principale noscitur esse caput; ecclesia vero
Romana est caput tocius ecclesie Dei; ergo ecclesia Dei
sine ecclesia Romana esse non potest. Illa autem ecclesia
sine qua ecclesia Dei nequit consistere non potest errare
contra fidem; ergo ecclesia Romana errare non potest
contra fidem.

exist without members; the church of believers,
however, is the mystical body of Christ; therefore
the church can not exist without members. However
the principal member is known to be the head; but
the Roman church is the head of the whole church of
God; therefore the church of God can not exist
without the Roman church. That church without
which the church of God can not exist, however, can
not err against faith. Therefore the Roman church
can not err against faith.

Octavo sic: illa ecclesia non potest contra fidem errare
quam nulla malicia valet extinguere; sed Romanam
ecclesiam nulla malicia valet extinguere, teste Pelagio
papa qui, ut habetur 24, q. 1, c. Pudenda, ait, "Cum
ecclesia una sit, nullam aliam esse constat nisi que in
apostolica est radice fundata." Et infra recitans verba
Augustini subiungit, "Si nullo modo recte potest dici
ecclesia in qua scisma est, restat ut, quoniam nulla
ecclesia esse non potest, ea sit quam in apostolice sedis
per successiones episcoporum radice constitutam
nullorum hominum malicia, eciam si nota excludi non
possit sed pro temporis racione tolleranda iudicetur, ullo
modo valeat extinguere." Ex quibus verbis datur intelligi
quod ecclesiam in radice apostolice sedis per
successiones episcoporum constitutam, que est Romana
ecclesia, nulla malicia valet extinguere; ergo ipsa contra
fidem errare non potest. Conclusionem predictam, quod
ecclesia Romana contra fidem errare non potest,
auctoritatibus fulcire nituntur. Ait enim Ieronimus, ut
legitur 24, q. 1, c. A recta, "Hec sancta et apostolica
mater omnium ecclesiarum Christi ecclesia que per
omnipotentis dei graciam a tramite apostolice tradicionis
numquam errasse probatur nec hereticis novitatibus
dampnanda succubuit, sed ut in exordio normam fidei
Christiane suscepit ab auctoritatibus apostolorum Christi
principibus illibata fide tenus manet." Et idem
Ieronimus, ut legitur 24, q. 1, c. Hec est fides, ait,
"Sancta Romana ecclesia que semper immaculata
permansit, Domino providente et beato Petro opem
ferente, in futuro seculo permanebit sine ulla
hereticorum insultacione firma et immobilis omni
tempore persistet." Ex hiis videtur quod Romana ecclesia
numquam contra fidem erravit nec errabit.

[It is shown] eighthly as follows. That church which
no evil can destroy can not err against faith. But no
evil can destroy the Roman church, as Pope Pelagius
attests. As we find in 24, q. 1, c. Pudenda, he says
[col.978], "Since there is one church it is certain that
there is no other one but that which is founded from
an apostolic source." Then reporting the words of
Augustine he adds, "If it can in no way properly be
said that a church in which there is schism persists,
then, since there can not be no church, that one
exists which, established by the successions of
bishops from the source of the apostolic see, the evil
of no men can in any way destroy (even if a known
[evil] can not be excluded but is considered as
needing to be tolerated because of the times)." We
are given to understand by these words that no evil
can destroy the church established by the
successions of bishops from the source of the
apostolic see and this is the Roman church.
Therefore it can not err against faith. They try to
strengthen with authoritative texts this conclusion
that the Roman church can not err against faith. For
as we read in 24, q. 1, c. A recta, Jerome says
[col.969], "This holy and apostolic church, the
mother of all the churches of Christ, is proved never
to have wandered from the path of apostolic
tradition through the grace of almighty God and has
not succumbed in a blameworthy way to heretical
novelties. But as it received the rule of christian
faith in the beginning from the chief texts of the
apostles of Christ it remains uninjured as far as faith
is concerned." As we read in 24, q. 1, c. Hec est
fides, Jerome also says [col.970], "The holy Roman
church, which with the Lord providing for it and
blessed Peter bringing it help has always remained
unstained, will in future ages remain strong and free
from the scoffing of heretics and will persist as
immovable throughout all time." It seems from these
[texts] that the Roman church has never erred and
never will err against faith.
