authority through which, or through
similar authority, he transferred the
Roman empire from the Greeks to the
Germans. He did not depose the king of
France, however, by the authority or
power given to him by Christ but he did
this (i) either by the authority of the
Franks, who gave him such authority and
power on that occasion [[?illa vice]] (ii)
or, as the gloss on the chapter Alius [col.
1083] says, "He is said to have deposed
because he agreed with those who were
deposing". So the pope did not transfer
the empire from the Greeks to the
Germans through the authority or power
given to him by Christ but (iii) through
the authority of the Romans who gave
such power to him in that office as the
most excellent person among the
Romans. (iv) Or he can be said to have
transferred it because he agreed with
those who were transferring.

Student That reply seems to be based on
the opinion which maintains that the pope
has some power directly from Christ, that
is power in spiritual matters and the right
of sharing in the material goods necessary
for his sustenance, and, in carrying out his
duty, he has some authority from general
councils, some from the congregation of
the faithful, at least by their tacit consent,
some from different peoples or emperors
or princes or others of the faithful. I can
find many things about this opinion in the
tractate, "On the power of the pope and
clergy". For the moment, therefore, I will
pass over many attacks on that reply and
bring forward just one, as follows.
