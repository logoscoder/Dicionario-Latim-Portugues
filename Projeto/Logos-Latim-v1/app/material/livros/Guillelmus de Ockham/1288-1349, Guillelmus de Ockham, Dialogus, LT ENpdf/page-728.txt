De mutatione autem modi dominandi et regendi
obedientes habetur {trs. &Pe} in scripturis fide
dignis. Aliquando enim habuerunt reges
aliquando consules aliquando unum qui
mutabatur singulis annis. Ultimo autem
imperatorem elegerunt {*trs. &NaRe} qui
absque mutatione omnibus imperaret. Ergo a
Romanis fuit Romanum imperium institutum.

Moreover, we find trustworthy things in
writings about changing the way of
dominating and ruling those obedient to
them. For sometimes they had kings,
sometimes consuls, sometimes one man
who was changed every year. Finally,
however, they chose an emperor who
commanded everyone without there being
a change. The Roman empire, therefore,
was established by the Romans.

Discipulus Non videtur quod a populo Romano
fuerit {fuit &MdMz} imperium verum {*trs.
&MzNaPeRe} sed solummodo {solum &Re}
usurpatum. Nam Romani alios oppresserunt.
{*Ergo nequaquam /non fuit &Mz\ verum
imperium /fuit add. &Re\ sed solummodo /om.
&Pe\ tyrannicum /tyrannice &Mz\ acquisierunt
/acquierunt &Pe\ add. &NaPeRe}.

Student It does not seem that it was a
true empire from the Roman people, but
only one that was usurped. For the
Romans oppressed others. They did not
acquire a true empire, therefore, but only
a tyrannical one.

Magister Ad hoc {ad hoc: adhuc &NaRe}
dupliciter respondetur: primo {*uno modo
&MzNaRe} quod Romani cernebant quod
necessarium fuit pro utilitate communi totius
mundi unum imperatorem universis mortalibus
dominari. Ideo qui contradixerunt unitati imperii
tanquam impedientes {*impeditores &MzNaRe}
boni communis potestas {*potestate &NaRe}
{potestatem &MzPz} ordinandi de imperio
{privati fuerunt. Quare /quando &Mz\ potestas
ordinandi de imperio add. &MdMzNaRe}
[[margin Md]] ad Romanos et ad {*om.
&MzNaPe} alios in {ad &Mz} hoc eis
consentientes {*trs. &NaRe} extitit devoluta. Et
ex tunc poterant Romani {romanos &Pz} licite
contradicentes et rebelles suo {sub &Pe} imperio
subiugare.

Master There are two replies to this. One
is that the Romans understood that it was
necessary for the common good of the
whole world that one emperor dominate
all people. Those who opposed the unity
of the empire, therefore, were deprived,
as hinderers of the common good, of the
power of making arrangements about the
emperor. The power of making
arrangements about the emperor,
therefore, fell to the Romans and to others
who agreed with them about this. And
thereafter the Romans could licitly
subjugate those who opposed or rebelled
against their empire.

Aliter {similiter &Md} dicitur {*quod add.
&MdMzNaPeRe} licet Romani primo et {om.
&Md} per multa tempora post iniuste

Otherwise it is said that although at first
and for a long time afterwards the
Romans unjustly forced others to be
