contra omne genus literarum post canonem Bibliae
licet sentire.

chance they suggest something other than what the
truth demands." We find from this that it is
permissible to think contrary to every sort of writing
after the canon of the bible.

His concordare videtur Augustinus in epistola ad
Fortunatum et habetur dist. praefata c. Neque qui ait,
"Neque quorumlibet disputationes," id est expositiones
secundum glossam, "quamvis catholicorum et
laudatorum hominum, velut scripturas canonicas
habere debemus, ut nobis non liceat, salva
honorificentia quae illis debetur hominibus, aliquid in
eorum scriptis improbare atque respuere, si forte
invenerimus, quod aliter senserint quam veritas habet,
divino adiutorio vel ab aliis intellecta vel a nobis." Ex
his
concluditur
quod
nullus
assertionibus
quorumcunque quae in Scripturis canonicis non
habentur firmiter assentire constringitur.

Augustine seems to agree with this in his letter to
Fortunatus which we find in the aforesaid distinction
[9], c. Neque [c. 10, col.18] where he says, "And we
should not consider the disputations," that is
expositions according to the gloss, "of any men at all,
even if they are catholic and praiseworthy, as
canonical writings, as if we were not permitted, saving
the honour that is owed those men, to condemn and
reject anything in their writings, if by chance we find
that they have thought otherwise than what the truth
holds, as understood with divine assistance either by
others or by ourselves." We conclude from these
[words] that no one is bound to assent firmly to
anyone's assertions which are not found in the
canonical scriptures.

Item de veritatibus quas docuit Augustinus quod nullus
teneatur eas de necessitate salutis recipere nisi in
scripturis
canonicis
habeantur,
per
eundem
Augustinum ostendunt. Nam in libro De trinitate, ut in
dist. 9 recitatur c. Noli, ait, "Noli meis litteris quasi
canonicis scripturis inservire. Sed in illis et quod non
credebas cum inveneris incunctanter crede. In istis
autem quod certum non habebas nisi certum
intellexeris noli firme tenere." Et in epistola ad
Vincentium Victorem libro 2, ut habetur dist. eadem c.
Negare, ait, "Negare non possum nec debeo, sicut in
ipsis maioribus, ita esse multa in tam multis opusculis
meis quae possunt iusto iudicio et nulla temeritate
culpari." Ex his concluditur quod scriptis beati
Augustini non est necesse incunctanter adhaerere; ergo
eadem ratione nec scriptis aliorum quorumcunque qui
inter scriptores bibliae non habentur.

Again, they show through Augustine that no one is
bound to accept as necessary for salvation the truths
which he himself taught unless they are found in the
canonical scriptures. For in his book On the trinity, as
recorded in dist. 9, c. Noli [c. 3, col.17], he says, "Do
not attend to my writings as to the canonical
scriptures. But believe the latter unhesitatingly, even
what you did not believe when you came across it; do
not hold firmly, however, to what you did not
consider as certain in the former unless you judge it to
be certain." And in book 2 of his letter to Vincent
Victor, as found in the same distinction [9] c. Negare
[c. 4, col.17], he says, "I can not and ought not deny
that there are many things in many works of mine, as
in those of our forefathers, which can be censured
with just judgement and without temerity." We
conclude from these that it is not necessary to adhere
unhesitatingly to the writings of blessed Augustine.
By the same argument therefore [this is not necessary]
with regard to the writings of any others at all who are
not found among the writers of the bible.

Sententiam etiam memoratam rationibus moliuntur
ostendere, quarum prima est haec. Extra illam
scripturam nulla catholica veritas invenitur in qua
omnis veritas utilis ad salutem habetur et omnis falsitas
inimica saluti damnatur; sed secundum Augustinum in
Scriptura Divina quicquid utile est invenitur, quicquid
noxium est damnatur; ergo extra Sacram Scripturam
nulla veritas catholica reperitur.

They try to show the above opinion by arguments too,
of which the first is this. No catholic truth is found
outside that writing in which every truth useful for
salvation is contained and every falsity inimical to
salvation is condemned; but according to Augustine
[at the end of book 2 of De doctrina christiana] it is in
divine scripture that whatever is useful is found and
whatever is harmful is condemned; therefore no
catholic truth is found outside sacred scripture.

Secunda ratio est haec. Non minus sufficiens pro
fidelibus christianis est Novum Testamentum una cum
Veteri quam fuit solummodo Vetus Testamentum pro
Hebraeis; sed tota fides ad quam astringebantur

A second argument is this. The New Testament
together with the Old is not less sufficient for
believing christians than was the Old Testament alone
for the Hebrews; but the whole faith to which the
