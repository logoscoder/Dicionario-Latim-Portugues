infideli tollit ius suum, ut scilicet per hoc quod
aliquis christianus efficitur vel efficiebatur
tempore Christi, sive apostolus sive alius,
imperator et alii sub eo nullum ius quod
habebant {habebat &Na} penitus perdiderunt.

right, even an unbeliever's, that is, neither the
emperor nor others under him completely lost
any right which they had because of the fact
that someone, whether an apostle or someone
else, becomes or became a christian in the
time of Christ.

Quod in verbis apostoli 1 Timoth. 6:[1]
innuitur, cum ait, "Quicumque sunt sub iugo
servi, dominos suos omni honore dignos
arbitrentur, ne nomen domini et doctrina
blasphemetur." Ex his enim verbis videtur
haberi quod subiecti dominis infidelibus,
quando efficiebantur christiani, ut prius in
omnibus dominis suis servire et obedire
debebant, ne domini dicerent quod religio
christiana esset iniuriosa et iniuriam dominis
conversorum facere niteretur.

This is implied in the words of the apostle in
1 Tim. 6:1, when he says, "Let all who are
under the yoke of slavery regard their masters
as worthy of all honour, so that the name of
God and the teaching may not be
blasphemed." For these words seem to hold
that when those subject to unbelieving
masters became christians they had to serve
and obey their masters in everything as
before, so that their masters would not say
that the christian religion was wrongful and
was trying to inflict a wrong on the masters
of converts.

Quod Augustinus aperte videtur {trs. &Na}
asserere exponens verba predicta; ait enim,
"Sciendum est quosdam predicasse
communem omnibus in Christo esse
libertatem; quod de spirituali utique libertate
verum est, non de carnali, ut illi intelligebant:
ideo contra eos loquitur hic apostolus iubens
servos dominis suis subditos esse. Non ergo
exigant servi christiani, quod de Hebreis
dicitur, ut sex annis serviant et gratis
dimittantur liberi, quod misticum est; et quare
hoc precipiat apostolus, supponit, ne
blasphemetur nomen domini quasi aliena
invadentis et doctrina christiana {christi &Na}
quasi iniusta et contra leges predicet, sed
pocius per obsequia servorum fidelium domini
infideles convertantur." Ex quibus verbis
concluditur quod per conversionem
apostolorum et assumptionem eorum ad
apostolatum domini infideles nullum ius in eis
quod prius habuerant amittebant, et ita
remanebant subditi eis in omnibus, sicut prius.

Augustine seems clearly to assert this when
he expounds those words. For he says, "It
should be known that certain people preached
that in Christ freedom was common to
everyone; this is certainly true about spiritual
freedom, not about carnal freedom as those
people meant; therefore the apostle speaks
against them, ordering slaves to be subject to
their masters. Christian slaves do not demand
what was said of the Hebrews, therefore, that
they serve six years and be freely released to
freedom. This is mystical, and so the apostle
instructs this, he assumes, so that the name of
the Lord is not blasphemed as one who takes
possession of what belongs to others and so
that christian teaching does not preach what
is as it were unjust and against the laws, but
rather that unbelieving masters are converted
by the obedience of believing slaves." We
conclude from these words that by the
conversion of the apostles and their
assumption into the apostolate their
unbelieving masters lost no right over them
that they had had before, and so they
remained subject to them just as before.
