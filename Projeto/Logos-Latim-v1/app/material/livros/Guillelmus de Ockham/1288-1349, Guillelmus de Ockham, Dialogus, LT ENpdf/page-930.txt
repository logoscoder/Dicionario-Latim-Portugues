supreme pontiff, therefore, either was not
granted to the clerics of the church where the
pope's see is by a special privilege, or, if it
was granted to them, it was taken away when
it was given to the cardinals, and because
when a privilege is null recourse should be
had to the common law, the conclusion is left
that if the cardinals become heretics, election
reverts to the whole Roman clergy. Gratian
seems to attest, however, that the common
law is that the whole clergy has the right to
elect. As we read in dist. 63, para. Ex his
[c.34, col.246], he says, "Just as the election
of the supreme pontiff should be carried out
not only by cardinals but indeed also, on the
authority of Pope Nicholas, by other religious
clerics, so is the election of bishops also not
to be carried out by canons only but also by
other religious clerics, as was determined at
the general synod held at Rome by Pope
Innocent." Whence Innocent too in the same
place in his c. Obeuntibus [c.35, col.247]
argues that this is the case: "Indeed, since
when bishops die the decrees of the holy
fathers forbid a vacancy of more than three
months in that church, we prohibit under a
penalty of anathema the canons of the
episcopal see from excluding religious men
from the election of bishops; rather, with
their advice they should elect an honest and
suitable person as bishop. But if the election
has been made with religious men excluded,
let it be considered invalid and void because
it had been carried out without their advice
and agreement." We gather from these words
that according to the common law election
belongs to the whole clergy.
