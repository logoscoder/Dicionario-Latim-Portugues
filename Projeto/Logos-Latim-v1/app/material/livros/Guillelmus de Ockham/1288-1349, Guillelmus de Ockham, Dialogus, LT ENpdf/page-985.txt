seculares causas, ecclesiasticus ecclesiasticas
audiat. Et sic planum est quod dicitur in textu,
sed {*scilicet &MzNaRe} cum dicit
Anacletus, 'coram patriacha aut primate
ecclesiastico {*ecclesiastica &NaReZn} et
coram patricio secularia negotia iudicentur'."
Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod in negotiis
secularibus a iudice seculari et per consequens
ab imperatore non est appellandum ad papam.

an ecclesiastical judge ecclesiastical cases.
And so what is said in the text is plain, when
Anacletus says, that is, 'Let ecclesiastical
business be judged before the patriarch or
primate and secular business before a
nobleman.'" We gather from these words that
in secular business there should be no appeal
to the pope from a secular judge, nor
consequently from the emperor.

Discipulus Si secundum glossam primam
vacante imperio licet appellare ad papam, ergo
papa habet disponere de imperio, et per
consequens imperator ratione imperii est
inferior papa. Et ita etiam non vacante imperio
licet appellare ab imperatore ad {om. &Mz}
papam, etiam in secularibus causis.

Student If in accordance with the first gloss it
is permitted to appeal to the pope when the
empire is unoccupied, the pope therefore has
the power to make dispositions for the
empire, and consequently the emperor, by
reason of the empire, is inferior to the pope.
And so even when the empire is not
unoccupied it is permitted to appeal from the
emperor to the pope, even in secular cases.

Magister Respondetur tibi quod papa vacante
imperio nihil habet disponere de imperio nisi
auctoritate imperatoris instituentis eum
vicarium suum vel auctoritate aliorum, scilicet
Romanorum vel principum quibus concessa
{*commissa &NaRe} est potestas ordinandi
quis debeat gerere vicem imperatoris vacante
imperio. Et ideo si vacante imperio contingit
appellare ad papam hoc est inquantum papa
gerit vicem imperatoris et locum imperatoris
tenet. Qui autem gerit vices {*vicem &NaRe}
alterius et locum eius tenet est inferior eo in
hoc, quia semper vicarius est inferior eo cuius
est vicarius. Ergo papa est in hoc {*trs.231
&NaRe} inferior et minor imperatore, et per
consequens ab ipso {*om. &NaRe} imperatore
non licet appellare ad papam.

Master The reply to you is that when the
empire is unoccupied the pope does not have
the power to make dispositions for the
empire, except by the authority of the
emperor appointing him as his vicar or by the
authority of others, that is of the Romans or
of princes to whom the power of arranging
who ought to act in place of the emperor
when the empire is unoccupied has been
committed. And therefore if it is possible to
appeal to the pope when the empire is
unoccupied, this is in so far as the pope acts
in place of the emperor and occupies the
emperor's place. He who acts in the place of
another, however, and occupies his place is
inferior to him in this, because a vicar is
always inferior to him whose vicar he is.
Therefore the pope in this is inferior to and
less than the emperor, and consequently it is
not permitted to appeal from the emperor to
the pope.

Discipulus Licet ista instantia apparenter
videatur {videtur &Mz} {inclusa vel add.
&Mz} exclusa, tamen adhuc videtur posse
ostendi quod pro negociis seu causis
secularibus liceat ab imperatore et aliis

Student Even if that example seems
apparently to be excluded, it still seems
showable nevertheless that it is permitted to
appeal from the emperor and other secular
judges to the pope for secular business or
