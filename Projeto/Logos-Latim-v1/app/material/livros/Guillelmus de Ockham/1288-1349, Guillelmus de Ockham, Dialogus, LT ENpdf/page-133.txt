Tertio sic. Ad correctionem illius qui debet esse paratus
ad satisfactionem poscenti rationem de fide non tenetur
quis opinionem suam erroneam revocare, nisi idem
rationem reddiderit quod talis opinio est tanquam
erronea revocanda, quia si aliquis absque reddita
ratione teneretur opinionem suam tanquam erroneam
revocare, alius non teneretur de opinione revocanda
rationem reddere. Sed praelati corripientes subditos de
erroribus contra fidem debent esse parati ad
satisfactionem poscenti rationem de fide, et per
consequens debent esse parati ad satisfactionem
rationem poscenti de his revocandis quae dicunt fidei
adversari, teste beato Petro qui in canonica sua prima c.
3, scribens praelatis singulariter ait, "Dominum autem
Christum sanctificate in cordibus vestris, parati semper
ad satisfactionem omni poscenti vos rationem de ea
quae in vobis est fide." Ergo subditi non tenentur
opiniones suas erroneas contra veritatem catholicam
revocare
propter
correctionem
praelatorum
quamcunque nisi fuerit legitima correctio modo
supradicto.

A third [argument proceeds] thus. At the correction
of that person who ought to be ready to satisfy
someone asking for an argument for faith, no one is
bound to retract his erroneous opinion unless that
same person has given a reason why such an opinion
should be retracted as erroneous. For if someone were
bound to retract his opinion as erroneous without a
reason being given, the other would not be bound to
give a reason why the opinion should be retracted.
But prelates correcting their subjects for errors
against faith ought to be ready to satisfy someone
asking for an argument for faith, and consequently
ought to be ready to satisfy someone asking for an
argument for retracting those things that they say are
opposed to the faith. Blessed Peter, writing
individually to his prelates in chapter 3 of his first
letter [1 Peter 3:15], testifies to this when he says:
"But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being
ready always to satisfy everyone that asketh you a
reason of that hope which is in you." Subjects are not
bound, therefore, to retract their erroneous opinions
that are against catholic truth because of any
correction at all by prelates, unless the correction is
legitimate in the aforesaid way.

Quarto sic: subditi non tenentur in illo casu ad
correctionem praelatorum opiniones quas ignorant esse
erroneas revocare, in quo casu licitum est eis a
praelatorum sententia appellare, quia qui valet licite ab
aliqua sententia appellare non tenetur eidem sententiae
obedire. Sed a praelato corripiente aliquem de errore et
non monstrante per regulam fidei quod dictus error
veritati repugnat licet appellare. Ergo propter talem
correctionem non tenetur quis opinionem quam nescit
esse erroneam revocare.

A fourth [argument proceeds] thus. At the correction
of their prelates, subjects are not bound in the
following case to retract opinions which they do not
know to be erroneous, namely if it is licit for them to
appeal against the sentence of their prelates, because
whoever is able licitly to appeal against some
sentence is not bound to obey that sentence. But it is
licit to appeal against a prelate correcting someone of
error and not showing by the rule of faith that the said
error is contrary to the truth. No one is bound because
of such correction, therefore, to retract an opinion
which he does not know to be erroneous.

Maior est manifesta; minor per sacros canones aperte
probatur. Ait enim Victor, ut habetur 2, q. 6, c. Si quis,
"Si quis putaverit se a proprio metropolitano gravari,
apud patriarcham vel primatem dioceseos aut penes
universalis ecclesiae apostolicae iudicetur sedem." Ex
quibus verbis colligitur quod si quis putaverit se a
praelato de errore inique correctum sibi licet appellare.
Quod etiam multis aliis sacris canonibus posset copiose
probari, sed causa brevitatis pertranseo.

The major [premise] is obvious. The minor is clearly
proved by sacred canons. For, as we find in 2, q. 6, c.
Si quis [("2"), col.468], Victor says: "If anyone thinks
that he has been oppressed by his own metropolitan,
he may be judged by his patriarch or diocesan primate
or in the presence of the see of the apostolic universal
church." We gather from these words that if someone
thinks that he has been unfairly convicted of an error
by his prelate it is licit for him to appeal. This could
also be proved copiously from many other sacred
canons, but I pass them over for the sake of brevity.

Discipulus Per istam rationem probatur quod correctus
legitime de errore non tenetur suum errorem revocare
quia licet sibi appellare.

Student By that argument it is proved that someone
legitimately convicted of error is not bound to retract
his error because it is licit for him appeal.

Magister Ad hoc respondetur quod correctus legitime a
praelato de errore, si appellat frustratorie aut frivole,
puniri debet per ecclesiam; qui etiam apud Deum

Master The answer to this is that if someone
legitimately convicted by his prelate of an error
appeals obstructively or frivolously he ought to be
