CAP. XVIII {XVII &PE}

Discipulus &Recita quomodo respondetur ad
auctoritates {*auctoritatem &MzNaPeRe}
apostoli 1 {*ad add. &Pe} Corinthios 6:[3] cum
dixit {*dicit &MzNaPeRe}, "Nescitis quoniam
angelos iudicabitis {*iudicabimus
&MzNaPeReVg}? Quanto magis secularia?"
{seculares &Mz} {quanto magis secularia: etc
&Pe}
Magister Respondent {*Respondetur
&MzNaPeRe} quod apostolus in illo {isto
&Mz} capitulo non intendit prohibere
Corinthiis {*Corinthios &MzNaRe} in omni
casu apud infideles iudicare {*iudicari
&MzNaPeRe}, nec intendit asserere quod soli
fideles habeant {*debent &MzPeRe} {debet
&Na} secularia iudicare, et ideo non
reprehendit omnes illos qui in quocunque casu
requirebant {in add. &Na} iudicium infidelium
- sic enim tam verbis quam factis sibimetipsi
fuisset contrarius - sed reprehendit solummodo
illos fideles qui indiscrete {indistincte &Re}
aut {*vel &MzNaRe} malitiose aut {vel &Pe}
scandalose apud infideles et iniquos iudicari
volebant. Ad cuius intelligentiam dicitur esse
sciendum quod, sicut iudex cum prospexerit
aliquos velle litigare coram se primum {*prius
&MzNaPeRe} {*potest et add. &MzNaRe}
debet inducere partes ut inter se componant
antequam incipiant litigare, Extra, De

dissidentes {desidentes &NaRe} fratres, sive
clericos sive laicos, ad pacem magis quam ad
iudicium coerceant {*cohortentur" &NaReZn}

CHAPTER 18

Student Set out what reply is made to the
text of the apostle in 1 Cor. 6:3 when he
says, "Do you not know that we are to
judge angels, to say nothing of secular
matters?"

Master The reply is that in that chapter the
apostle is not intending to forbid the
Corinthians from being judged by
unbelievers in every case, nor is he
intending to assert that only believers
should judge secular matters, and therefore
he is not rebuking all those who in any case
at all sought the judgement of unbelievers for he would have been contradicting
himself both in word and in deed - but he is
rebuking only those believers who
indiscriminately, maliciously or
scandalously want to be judged by
unbelievers and enemies. To understand
this it is said that it should be known that,
just as when a judge discerns that some
people want to litigate before him he can
and should first induce the parties to agree
between themselves before they begin to
litigate (Extra, De transactionibus, last
chapter [Ex parte c.11, col.210], and Extra,
De symonia, c. Querelam [c.15, col.753],
and 5, q. 2, c. Si primates [c.4, col.546],
and dist. 90, c, Studendum [c.7, col.314],
where we read the following, "Bishops
should take pains to urge brothers who
disagree, whether clerics or laymen,
towards peace rather than towards the
court."), so the ruler of any particular
college should induce his subjects, if one of
them has a lawsuit against another, to agree
rather than to come to court and, if they can
not agree between themselves in a friendly
way, he can induce them, without prejudice
to a superior judge, to litigate first, when
they are able to do so, before a judge or
judges set up or chosen by themselves or by
