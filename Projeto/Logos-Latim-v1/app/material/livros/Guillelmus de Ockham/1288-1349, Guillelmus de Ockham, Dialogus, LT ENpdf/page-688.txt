who swears to someone not to harm his
body swears the fidelity to him that a
vassal owes his lord. For, as we read in 1
Kings 30, David swore an oath to the
Egyptian boy who was going to lead him
to the Amelakites who had attacked
Sichelet that he would not kill him and
would not deliver him into the hands of
his lord, and yet David did not swear to
that boy the fidelity that a vassal owes his
lord. And consequently the fact that Otto
swore to the pope that he would not lose
his life or his limbs by his (Otto's) will or
advice did not reveal an oath of fidelity to
him; indeed although he had sworn to him
that he would never do any wrong to him
it could not be concluded that he had
sworn the fidelity to him that a vassal
owes to his lord. For Isaac swore in this
way to Abimelech, king of the Philistines,
yet he was not his vassal and he did not
swear to him the fidelity which a vassal
owes his lord, although he did swear to
him that he would do him no harm and
Abimelech made a similar oath. For this
is what we read in Genesis 26:26-29 &
31, "When Abimelech went to him from
Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and
Phicol the commander of his army, Isaac
said to them, `Why have you come to me
seeing that you hate me and have sent me
away from you?' They replied, `We have
seen that the Lord is with you; so we say,
let there be an oath between us and let us
make a covenant so that you will do us no
harm.' ... In the morning they arose early
and exchanged oaths." We gather from
these words that Isaac and another man,
neither of whom was the other's vassal,
swore an oath that they would not harm
each other. And consequently, although
Otto swore to the pope that he would not
harm his body and would not secretly
harm his fortifications, his justice, his
possessions or anything at all pertaining
to him, it could not be concluded from
this that he had sworn to him the fidelity a
vassal owes his lord, because the oath
