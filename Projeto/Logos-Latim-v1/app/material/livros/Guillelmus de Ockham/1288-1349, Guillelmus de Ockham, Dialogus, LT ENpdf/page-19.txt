Magister: Alii dicunt quod ad theologos spectat scire Master: Others say that it pertains chiefly to

theologians to know who should be considered
pertinacious.
Primum autem motivum eorum est tale. Ad theologos Their first reason is the following. It pertains chiefly to
pertinet principaliter tractare de illis criminibus que theologians to treat of those crimes that are directly
directe committuntur in Deum, quia, cum theologia sit committed against God because, since theology has God

Secundum motivum est tale. Eadem est scientia The second reason is as follows. "The science of [each

consequens de pertinacia, sine qua heretica pravitas are contraries. But it pertains chiefly to theologians to

reflect on faith. Therefore it pertains to the same people
to reflect on heretical wickedness, and, as a
consequence, on pertinacity, without which heretical
wickedness is not found.
Tertium motivum est hoc . Quando scientia superior et The third reason is this. When a superior and an inferior
inferior considerant de eodem , notitia illius principalius science reflect on the same thing, knowledge of that

quia superior cognoscit per causas superiores et per to the inferior, because the superior knows through
