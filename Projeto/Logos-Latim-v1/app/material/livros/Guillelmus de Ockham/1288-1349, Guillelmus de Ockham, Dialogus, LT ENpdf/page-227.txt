Hierosolymitanam totam a fide recedere; ergo
temerarium est dicere quod Deus numquam permittet
omnes Romanos a fide recedere. Et ita Romana ecclesia
errare poterit contra fidem.

but God permitted the whole Jerusalem church to
withdraw from the faith; it is rash to say, therefore,
that God will never permit all the Romans to
withdraw from the faith. And so the Roman church
will be able to err against faith.

Discipulus Quamvis omnes Romani qui conversantur
Rome contra fidem errarent, Romana tamen ecclesia
non erraret, quia tunc Romana ecclesia non esset Rome
sed alibi, sicut modo Romana ecclesia est apud
Avinionem.

Student: Even if all the Romans who live in Rome
were to err against faith, the Roman church would
nevertheless not err, because then the Roman church
would not be at Rome but elsewhere, just as the
Roman church is now at Avignon.

Magister Dicunt isti quod in hoc cavillose per
equivocacionem conaris procedere, quia, querunt, quam
ecclesiam vocas Romanam ecclesiam? Populum seu
multitudinem Romanorum, sive clericorum sive
laicorum, in partibus Romanis degencium vel domicilia
ibidem habencium? Aut vocas ecclesiam Romanam
clericos titulos habentes in Roma? Aut vocas ecclesiam
Romanam papam cum cardinalibus, vel papam solum,
vel solum collegium cardinalium? Aut vocas ecclesiam
Romanam illos qui tenent fidem quam apostoli
fundaverunt et predicaverunt Rome?

Master: They say that using an ambiguity you are
trying to proceed in this argument by a quibble,
because, they ask, what church are you calling the
Roman church? The people or multitude of Romans,
either clerics or laypeople, living in the area of Rome
or having their dwellings there? Or are you calling
the Roman church the clerics who have titular
churches in Rome? Or are you calling the Roman
church the pope together with the cardinals or the
pope alone or the college of cardinals alone? Or are
you calling the Roman church those who maintain
the faith which the apostles founded and preached at
Rome?

Si primo modo vocas ecclesiam Romanam, stat
argumentum quia omnes Romani habentes domicilia
Rome possent contra fidem errare, sicut et omnes
Hierosolymitani aliquando erraverunt.

If you are using 'Roman church' in the first way, the
argument stands because all Romans having their
dwelling in Rome could err against faith, just as all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem did indeed err at one
time.

Si secundo modo, adhuc stat argumentum quia non
magis sunt electi a Deo clerici habentes titulos in Roma
quam fuerint clerici habentes titulos in Hierosolymis;
illi autem omnes erraverunt, ergo et omnes habentes
titulos in Roma possent errare. Item temerarium est
dicere quod non possent omnes habentes titulos in
Roma a paganis vel aliis malis occidi; ergo tunc non
esset fides in clericis titulos Rome habentibus, et tamen
non deficeret fides. Ergo de illis non sunt intelligenda
verba Christi quibus promisit fidem usque ad finem
seculi duraturam.

If [you are using it] in the second way, the argument
still stands because clerics having churches in Rome
have not been more chosen by God than were the
clerics who had churches in Jerusalem; all of them
erred, however, and so all those having churches in
Rome could err. It is also rash to say that all those
having titular churches in Rome could not be killed
by pagans or by other evil people. In that case there
would then be no faith in clerics having titular
churches in Rome, and yet faith would not fail.
Therefore Christ's words promising that the faith
would last until the end of the age should not be
understood of those people.

Si vero vocas ecclesiam Romanam papam cum
cardinalibus vel papam solum vel collegium
cardinalium solum, adhuc potest errare, quia
temerarium est dicere papam cum duobus cardinalibus,
si non essent plures, non posse errare contra fidem.

But if you are calling the Roman church the pope
together with the cardinals or the pope alone or the
college of cardinals alone, still it can err, because it is
rash to say that the pope together with two cardinals,
if there were not more, can not err against faith.

Si autem vocas Romanam ecclesiam illam ecclesiam
que tenet fidem quam apostoli fundaverunt et
predicaverunt Rome, sic concedunt quod Romana
ecclesia errare non potest; sed illa Romana ecclesia est

If however you are calling the Roman church that
church which maintains the faith which the apostles
founded and preached at Rome they grant in that case
that the Roman church can not err; but that Roman
