condemnamus vocaliter in sua prohibitione nequaquam
expresserit.

not vocally express a determination such as, "We
condemn it as heretical".

Hoc etiam ratione probatur. Nam veritas explicite
approbata et in veritate catholica fundata pro catholica
debet haberi; ergo et falsitas contraria debet haeretica
iudicari; sed sive approbetur veritas sive damnetur
contraria falsitas, semper veritas approbatur quia
reprobatio unius contradictoriarum est alterius
approbatio et econverso; ergo talis assertio contraria
veritati in fide fundatae catholica haeretica est
censenda et pro damnata explicite est habenda.

This is also proved by argument. For an explicitly
approved truth which is based on catholic truth should
be considered as catholic; its opposing falsehood
therefore should be judged as heretical; but whether a
truth be approved or its opposing falsehood
condemned, the truth is always approved because the
rejection of one of [a pair] of contradictories involves
the approval of the other, and vice versa; therefore an
assertion of a kind that is opposed to a truth based on
catholic faith, should be considered heretical and
accounted condemned.

Capitulum 29

Chapter 29

Discipulus Adhuc habeo quod de haeresum
damnatione interrogem. Mihi enim apparet quod omnis
error qualitercunque sive patenter sive latenter
Scripturae Divinae obvians et repugnans numero
haeresum aggregetur; constat autem quod theologi de
his quae spectant ad Scripturam Sacram contrarie
opinantur, qui tamen omnes opiniones suas Scriptura
Divina fulcire nituntur et per eandem Scripturam
Sacram opiniones contrarias reprobare moliuntur; ergo
aliquae dictarum opinionum contrariarum numero
haeresum
aggregantur.
Nunquid
ergo
papa
damnabiliter peccat negligendo huiusmodi haereses
condemnare?

Student There is something further I will ask about
the condemnation of heresies. For it seems to me that
every error that is opposed to and inconsistent with
divine scripture in any way at all, whether openly or
secretly, may be added to the number of the heresies;
it is certain however that theologians offer opposed
opinions about those matters that pertain to sacred
scripture, while nonetheless striving to support all
their opinions with divine scripture and trying to reject
opposed opinions through the same sacred scripture;
some of these said opposed opinions, therefore, are
added to the number of the heresies. Does a pope sin
culpably, therefore, by neglecting to condemn heresies
of this kind?

Is a pope to blame if he does not condemn the heresies of well-intentioned theologians?
Magister Quidam dicunt quod papa in nullo peccat
permittendo theologos huiusmodi assertiones quae sunt
in rei veritate haereticae opinando tenere, quod tali
ratione videtur posse probari. Permittere licita non est
peccatum, cum quandoque absque peccato illicita
permittantur; sed huiusmodi errores qui non sunt
damnati explicite opinando tenere est licitum, quia talis
opinio, quamdiu opinans paratus est corrigi, opinantem
non reddit haereticum; ergo absque peccato permittit
papa theologos huiusmodi errores qui in rei veritate
sunt haereses opinando tenere.

Master Some people say that the pope does not sin at
all in allowing theologians to hold as their opinion
assertions of this kind which are in truth of fact
heretical, and this seems provable by the following
argument. It is not heretical to allow what is
permissible since sometimes what is impermissible is
allowed without sin; but it is permissible to hold as an
opinion errors of this kind which have not been
condemned explicitly because such an opinion does
not make the one who holds it a heretic as long as he
is prepared to be corrected; [See Significant Variants,
para. 7.] the pope is without sin, therefore, in allowing
theologians to hold as their opinion errors of this kind
which are in truth of fact heresies.

Alii sentiunt quod plures summi pontifices
damnabiliter in hoc peccaverunt permittendo haereses
huiusmodi etiam opinando teneri. Quod probant primo
sic: non solum haeretici sed etiam haereses sunt de
ecclesia exstirpandae teste concilio generali quod,
prout

Others think that many highest pontiffs have sinned
culpably in allowing heresies of this kind to be held
even as an opinion. They prove this first as follows:
not only should heretics be rooted out of the church
but also heresies, as the general council found in
Extra, De hereticis, c. Excommunicamus [col.1685]
attests; it indicates that bishops who have been
