Magister Non plene intelligis rationem eorum. Non
enim intendunt probare quod modo liceat inferioribus
papa asserentem vel assertionem eius quod aliquis pro
quo dicitur Deus facere miracula non est sanctus
damnare, sed intendunt arguere quod qua ratione licuit
eis talem errorem damnare licuit etiam eis alios errores,
ex quibus et aliis veris manifestis potest concludi
haeresis manifesta, damnare. Potestas autem super
alios errores non est revocata. Ergo adhuc possunt
errores alios condemnare, licet modo asserentem
aliquem pro quo dicunt miracula fieri non esse sanctum
nequeant condemnare.

Master You do not fully understand their argument.
For they do not intend to prove that it would now be
licit for those inferior to the pope to condemn
someone who asserts, or his assertion, that someone
on behalf of whom God is said to perform miracles is
not a saint, but they intend to argue that for the reason
for which it was licit for them to condemn such an
error it was also licit for them to condemn other errors
from which, with the addition of other obvious truths,
a manifest heresy can be inferred. Their power over
other errors, however, has not been revoked.
Therefore they can still condemn other errors,
although they can not now condemn anyone asserting
that someone for whom they say miracles have been
performed is not a saint.

Discipulus Dictam rationem magis adverto, et ideo
quomodo ad motivum aliorum respondetur expone.

Student I understand the said argument more, and so
explain how it replies to the argument of the others.

Magister Dicitur quod licet non valeant haereses
condemnare, possunt tamen alios errores multos
minores haeresibus condemnare quia inferiores possunt
minora quibus tamen maiora negocia interdicta
noscuntur, quia, ut ex lege divina Deuteronomii 1
colligitur, maiora negocia ad maiores oportet referre.
Nec tamen est dicendum quin praelati haeresibus
resistere teneantur, sed non debent eis resistere
condemnando sed eas summo pontifici vel generali
concilio nunciando.

Master It is said that although they can not condemn
heresies, they can nevertheless condemn many other
errors more minor than heresies, because inferiors to
whom greater affairs are known to be forbidden can
undertake lesser ones since, as we gather from the
divine law in Deuteronomy 1, it is necessary to refer
greater affairs to greater men. Yet it should not be said
that prelates are not bound to resist heresies, but they
should not resist them by condemning them, but by
announcing them to the highest pontiff or to a general
council.

Chapter 1

Discipulus De veritatibus catholicis sufficit praedicta
quaesisse. Nunc vero de catholicis et haereticis conabor
nonnulla inquirere. Primo autem quaero quis debet
catholicus reputari.

Disciple Concerning Catholic truths the above
investigation is enough. Now, however, I will try to
investigate some points concerning Catholics and
heretics. And first I ask who should be regarded as a
Catholic.

Who should be regarded as a Catholic?
Magister Ille est censendus catholicus qui integram et Master He should be considered a Catholic who
inviolatam servat catholicam fidem.
observes the Catholic faith whole and inviolate.
Discipulus Quomodo potest simplex laicus integram
fidem servare, qui de multis quae ad fidem catholicam
spectant nunquam cogitavit? Talis ergo laicus
catholicus esse non potest si omnis catholicus integram
tenet catholicam fidem.

Disciple How can a simple layman observe the whole
faith, who has never thought of many things that
belong to the Catholic faith? Such a layman therefore
cannot be a Catholic, if every Catholic holds the whole
Catholic faith.

Magister Respondent theologi quod servare vel tenere Master Theologians answer that to observe or hold the
integram fidem contingit omnia quae ad fidem pertinent whole faith is possible by believing faithfully and
