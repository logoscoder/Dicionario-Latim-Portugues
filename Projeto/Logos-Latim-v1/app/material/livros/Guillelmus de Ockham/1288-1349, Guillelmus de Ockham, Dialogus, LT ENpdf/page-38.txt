Student I would gladly know whether everyone is
united in the thought that heresy should be described
in the above way.

"New" heresies and "new" Catholic truths
Magister Sunt quidam qui non putant haeresim taliter
describendam. Qui tali rationi inniti videntur: multa
dogmata falsa fidei contraria orthodoxae fiunt noviter
haereses quamvis non de novo incipiant esse falsa fidei
contraria orthodoxae; ergo priusquam debeant haereses
reputari sunt dogmata falsa fidei contraria orthodoxae;
ex quo evidenter concluditur quod non omnia dogmata
falsa fidei contraria orthodoxae debent haereses
reputari. Antecedens videtur evidens quia multae sunt
novae haereses quamvis prius fuerint falsa dogmata
fidei contraria orthodoxae. Urbanus enim papa, ut
habetur 24, q. 3, c. Notandum, ait, "Sanctus Augustinus
cum legatis sanctae Romanae ecclesiae et cum sanctis
episcopis suis Pelagium et Caelestinum novam
haeresim in sanctam Dei ecclesiam introducentes
excommunicavit." Ex quibus verbis colligitur quod
Pelagius et Caelestinus opinionem quae erat tunc nova
haeresis in ecclesiam induxerunt, et tamen illa opinio
prius fuit fidei contraria orthodoxae. Ergo illa opinio
seu assertio priusquam esset haeresis fuit dogma
falsum fidei contrarium orthodoxae, et ita illa non est
descriptio convertibilis cum haeresi. Hinc Gratianus
24, q. 1, para. 1 ait, "Omnis haereticus aut iam
damnatam haeresim sequitur aut novam confingit." Et
glossa ibidem dicit, "Tu dic indistincte quod sive
veterem," scilicet haeresim, "sive novam sequatur
excommunicatus est, licet sit occultus." Glossa etiam
ibidem ait, "Si scirem praelatum meum esse
haereticum quia novam haeresim fingit nec tamen
praedicaret si me excommunicaret celebrarem in
occulto." Ex his habetur aperte quod fuerunt et possunt
esse novae haereses quae tamen non sunt nova falsa
fidei contraria orthodoxae; et per consequens non omne
falsum fidei contrarium orthodoxae debet inter
haereses computari.

Master There are some people who think that heresy
should not be described in such a way. They seem to
rely on the following argument. Many false doctrines
contrary to orthodox faith newly become heresies
although they do not begin from the start to be
falsities contrary to orthodox faith; therefore they are
false doctrines contrary to orthodox faith before they
should be regarded as heresies; we conclude evidently
from this that not all false doctrines contrary to
orthodox faith should be regarded as heresies. The
antecedent seems evident because many heresies are
new although previously they were false doctrines
contrary to orthodox faith. For as we find in 24, q. 3,
c. Notandum [col.1000], Pope Urban says, "St.
Augustine, together with legates of the holy Roman
church and his own holy bishops, excommunicated
Pelagius and Celestine for introducing a new heresy
into the holy church of God." We gather from these
words that Pelagius and Celestine introduced into the
church an opinion that at that time was a new heresy,
and yet that opinion was previously contrary to
orthodox faith. Before that opinion or assertion was a
heresy, therefore, it was a false doctrine contrary to
orthodox faith, and so that description is not
convertible with heresy. Hence Gratian says in 24, q.
1, para. 1 [col.966], "Every heretic either follows a
heresy already condemned or invents a new one." And
at that place [s. v. quod autem; col.1382] the gloss
says, "Say without distinction that whether he follows
a new one," that is a heresy, "or an old one he is
excommunicated, even if he is hidden." The gloss also
says at that point [s. v. qui vero; col.1382], "If I knew
that my prelate was a heretic because he invented a
new heresy and yet he was not preaching it, I would
celebrate in secret if he were to excommunicate me."
We clearly find from these that there have been and
can be new heresies, which, nevertheless, are not new
falsities contrary to orthodox faith; and therefore not
every falsity contrary to orthodox faith should be
counted among the heresies.
