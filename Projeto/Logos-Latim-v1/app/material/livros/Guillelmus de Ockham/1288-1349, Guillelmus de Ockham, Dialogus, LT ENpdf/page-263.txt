Magister Potest dici quod verba illa debent intelligi
specialiter de tribulacione fidelium, qui scilicet rectam
fidem tenent de Deo, inter quos quidam sunt electi et
alii ad penam eternam sunt presciti; et non de
quacumque tribulacione, sed de tribulacione que erit
sub Antichristo quando tantam habebunt tribulacionem
quantam rectam fidem tenentes numquam habuerunt,
licet sepe infideles maiorem tribulacionem habuerint et
sint forsitan habituri. Tribulacio enim facta per
diluvium respectu infidelium erat maior quam erit
tribulacio tempore antichristi respectu fidelium, quia
tunc omnes infideles pariter perierunt, sed respectu
fidelium non erit tanta tempore antichristi quia non
omnes fideles peribunt. Maior eciam fuit tribulacio
Sodomorum quando quinque civitates subverse fuerunt
quam erit tribulacio fidelium tempore antichristi. Et ita
sepe maior fuit tribulacio infidelium quam erit illa
tribulacio quam Christus predixit futuram, que tamen
forsitan erit tanta quod fideles paucissimi remanebunt
firmi in fide. Et an illi fideles erunt viri vel mulieres,
solus Deus novit et illi quibus Deus specialiter revelavit.

Master: It can be said that those words should be
understood particularly of the suffering of the
faithful, of those, that is, who maintain a right faith in
God, among whom some have been chosen and
others foreknown for eternal punishment; and not of
any suffering at all, but the suffering that will come
about under anti-Christ when they will have so great
a suffering as those maintaining right faith never had
[before], although often unbelievers have had greater
suffering and perhaps will have in the future. For the
suffering brought about to unbelievers by the flood
was greater than will be the suffering of believers in
the time of anti-Christ, because then all the
unbelievers perished together, but it will not be so
great for believers at the time of anti-Christ because
not all of them will perish. Greater too was the
suffering of the people of Sodom when five cities
were destroyed than will be the suffering of believers
in the time of anti-Christ. And so the suffering of
unbelievers has often been worse than will be the
suffering that Christ predicted will come. This will
nevertheless perhaps be so great that very few
believers will remain firm in faith. And whether
those believers will be men or women, only God
knows and those to whom God has particularly
revealed it.

Ad secundam instanciam potest dici quod electi
comprehendunt viros et mulieres, et ideo per hoc quod
iuxta promissionem Christi tempore antichristi
remanebunt electi, non potest concludi quod illi electi
erunt viri. Mulieres enim poterunt tunc esse electe.

To the second objection it can be said that the elect
include men and women, and so from the fact of
Christ's promise that in the time of anti-Christ the
elect will endure, it can not be concluded that those
elect will be men. For women will be able to be elect
then.

Discipulus Videtur quod illi qui tenent predictam
assercionem non multum reputarent de stabilitate et
constancia Christianorum.

Student: It seems that those who maintain that
assertion do not think much of the stability and
constancy of Christians.

Magister Est quedam assercio qua affirmatur aperte
quod temerarium est asserere omni tempore futuros
Christianos qui erunt constanciores in fide quam fuerint
Iudei. Quamvis enim fuerint Christiani in fide
constantissimi, et aliqui firmi in fide sint futuri, tamen
nescitur ab aliquo viatore, nisi alicui Deus revelaverit,
an multitudo catholicorum ad illam paucitatem deveniet
in qua fuit tempore Noe et temporibus Patriarcharum et
in veteri lege, et an Sarraceni vel alii infideles omnes
regiones Christianorum et fidelium occupabunt. In
talibus enim aliquid diffinire est de futuris temere
divinare. Poterit enim Deus, exigentibus Christianorum
demeritis, permittere omnes ab infidelibus subiugari et,
paucis exceptis, ad sectam eorum converti. Qui postea
poterit, si voluerit, sua pietate totum mundum ad fidem
convertere, quemadmodum per paucos discipulos
magnam partem mundi fidei subiugavit. Et ideo sunt
quidam dicentes quod si Sarraceni vel alii infideles
Christianitatem invaserint, temere Christiani presument

Master: There is a certain assertion that openly
affirms that it is rash to assert that at any time there
will be Christians who will be more constant in faith
than were the Jews. For although Christians have
been very constant in faith, and some will be firm in
faith in the future, it can nevertheless not be known
by any pilgrim, except one God has revealed it to,
whether the multitude of catholics will come to as
small a number as there was in the time of Noah, the
times of the Patriarchs and under the old law, and
whether Saracens or other unbelievers will occupy all
the lands of Christians and believers. For to decide
something in such matters is rashly to predict future
events. For when the faults of Christians demand it
God will be able to allow all of them to be subjugated
by unbelievers and, with few exceptions, to be
converted to their sect. Afterwards, if he wants to, he
will be able to convert the whole world to the faith
through their [the few's] piety, just as he subjugated a
