{*disponentur &NaRe} per unum quam per
plures. dicitur {*om. &NaRe} Ergo quod
{*quia &NaRe} ex tali pluralitate faciliter
orietur {*oritur &NaRe} {oriretur &Mz}
guerra et seditio ac discordia tam inter ipsos
iudices sua potestate uti volentes quam etiam
inter ipsos subditos quorum aliqui ex diversis
causis imo innumerabilibus possunt inclinari ut
uni obediant et non {alicui add. &Mz} alteri
{*alii &NaRe}, alii autem poterunt ad alium
inclinari, ideo communitas quae habet diversos
iudices summos {*supremos &NaRe} quibus
vel {quibus vel om. &NaRe} quorum {trs.321
&Mz} uno {*om. &MzNaRe} {*quilibet add.
&NaRe} seorsum absque alio valeat punire
eosdem delinquentes pessima et
periculosissima est censenda.

gives rise, therefore, to war, sedition and
discord, both among the judges themselves
wanting to use their power and among their
subjects, some of whom can be inclined for
different, indeed for innumerable, reasons to
obey one and not another, while others could
be inclined towards another, a community
which has different supreme judges, any one
of whom can without another punish the
same transgressors, should as a result be
considered very bad and most dangerous.

Quod veritas etiam {*trs. &NaRe} {*ipsa add.
&NaRe} apertissime testari videtur quae
Matthaei 6:[24] ait, "Nemo potest duobus
dominis servire; aut enim unum odio habebit et
alterum diliget, aut unum sustinebit et alterum
contemnetur {*contemnet &MzNaReVg}." Ex
quibus verbis habetur quod nemo debet habere
duos dominos vel duos iudices quorum unus
non est sub alio.

[4] Truth himself seems very clearly to testify
to this when he says at Matthew 6:24, "No
one can serve two masters; for he will either
hate the one and love the other, or be devoted
to the one and despise the other." We find
from these words that no one ought to have
two masters or two judges, one of whom is
not under the other.

Discipulus Ista auctoritas non videtur
concludere opinioni {*propositum &NaRe}
quia Christus loquitur de dominis contrariis qui
actu {*om. &MzNaRe} contraria {communia
&Mz} iubent.

Student That text does not seem to
demonstrate the proposition because Christ is
talking about opposed lords who order
opposed things.

Magister Haec responsio ab {*om.
&MzNaRe} aliis minime satisfacit quia Deus
{*Dominus &NaRe} loquitur non solum de
dominis contrariis actu {*trs. &NaRe}, hoc est
qui actu contraria {communia &Mz} iubent,
sed etiam de illis qui proni sunt ad iubendum
contraria et de quibus est probabiliter
formidandum quod inter se dissentientes
iubebunt contraria. Cum ergo nostra {*om.
&NaRe} natura humana sit prona ad
dissentiendum non immerito est timendum
quod si eadem communitas habuerit duo
capita, {*capita add. &MzNaRe} ipsa {om.

Master That reply does not satisfy some
people, because the Lord is talking not only
about lords actually opposed, that is who
actually order opposed things, but also about
those who are inclined to the ordering of
opposed things and of whom it is to be feared
with probability that, disagreeing among
themselves, they will order opposed things.
Since therefore our human nature is inclined
to disagreement, it should not without cause
be feared that if the same community had two
heads, those heads will disagree with each
other because there will be as many opinions
