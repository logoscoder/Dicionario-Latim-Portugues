Romanos pontifices, qui totam fidem approbando
omnem falsitatem contrariam damnaverunt, implicite
vel explicite condemnata. Si detur secundum, scilicet
quod aliqua assertio ideo solummodo est haeretica quia
explicite condemnata, ergo ista assertio, "Christus non
est homo", non erat haeretica antequam esset per
ecclesiam condemnata, quod isti pro manifesto
maximo inconvenienti habent.

permissibly be condemned is now a heresy, because
every such [assertion] has already been condemned
implicitly or explicitly by the church and by the
Roman pontiffs who by approving the whole of faith
have condemned every contrary falsity. [Cii] If the
second is granted, namely that any assertion is
heretical only because it has been explicitly
condemned, then the assertion, "Christ is not a man",
was not heretical before it was condemned by the
church, and they hold this as clearly irrational.

Quarta ratio quae eis demonstrativa videtur est haec.
Omnis assertio cuius pertinax defensator est vere
haereticus est vere haeresis; sed omnes pertinaces
defensatores assertionum quae possunt per ecclesiam
rite et legitime tanquam haereses condemnari sunt vere
haeretici, licet eorum assertiones non sint de facto
explicite et sub forma propria ab ecclesia condemnatae;
ergo tales assertiones ante damnationem huiusmodi
vere sunt inter haereses numerandae. Maior est
manifesta quia nemo est haereticus nisi propter
haeresim cui adhaeret. Minor auctoritatibus beati
Augustini probatur, qui, ut habetur 24, q. 3, c. Dixit
apostolus et c. Qui in ecclesia, asserit manifeste quod
qui sententiam falsam ac perversam et qui morbidum
aliquid et pravum sapiunt et corrigi nolunt sunt
heretici; sed omnis assertio que potest per ecclesiam
rite damnari est falsa, perversa, morbida et prava; ergo
omnis pertinax defensator talis assertionis, licet non sit
de facto explicite per ecclesiam condemnata, est vere
hereticus. Ex his concludunt isti quod ecclesia non
potest facere de assertione non heretica hereticam, sed
ecclesia aliquam heresim condemnando determinat et
diffinit eam fuisse et esse hereticam.

[D] A fourth reason, which seems demonstrative to
them, is this. Every assertion is truly a heresy if a
pertinacious defender of it is truly a heretic; but all
pertinacious defenders of assertions which can rightly
and legitimately be condemned by the church as
heresies are truly heretics, even if their assertions have
not in fact been condemned explicitly and in that
exact form by the church; such assertions, therefore,
should truly be reckoned among the heresies before a
condemnation of this kind. The major [premise] is
manifest because no one is a heretic except on account
of a heresy to which he adheres. The minor [premise]
is proved by texts from blessed Augustine who
manifestly affirms, as we find in 24, q. 3, c. Dixit
apostolus [col.998] and c. Qui in ecclesia [col.998],
that those who hold a false and perverse opinion and
those who hold something unwholesome and evil and
refuse to be corrected are heretics; but any assertion
that can rightly be condemned by the church is false,
perverse, unwholesome and evil; every pertinacious
defender of such an assertion, therefore, even if in fact
it has not been explicitly condemned by the church, is
truly a heretic. They conclude from this that the
church can not make heretical an assertion that is not
heretical, but, by condemning any heresy, the church
determines and defines that it has been and is
heretical.

Discipulus Istae ultimae rationes apparent mihi fortes
et tamen rationes pro prima sententia videntur
difficiles; et ideo refer quomodo respondetur ad ipsas.

Student Those last arguments seem strong to me, and
yet the arguments for the first opinion seem difficult.
Set forth, therefore, how reply is made to them.

Magister Ad primam illarum respondent secundae
sententiae assertores dicentes quod sicut saepe aliquis
est haereticus et tamen quia est tantummodo occultus
haereticus non debet tanquam haereticus iudicari, ita
saepe aliquis est haereticus quia haeresi pertinaciter
adhaeret et tamen quia non est certum explicite quod
assertio sua est et fuit haeretica, antequam explicite
innotuerit ecclesiae quod assertio sua est et fuit
haeretica, non debet tanquam haereticus condemnari.
Postquam autem per diligentem considerationem
innotuerit ecclesiae quod assertio sua est haeretica si
pertinax invenitur debet tanquam haereticus

Master In response to the first of them those who
affirm the second opinion say that, just as often
someone is a heretic and yet ought not be judged as a
heretic because he is only a secret heretic, so often
someone is a heretic because he clings pertinaciously
to a heresy and yet because it is not explicitly certain
that his assertion is and was heretical he should not be
condemned as a heretic before it has become
explicitly known to the church that his assertion is and
was heretical. After it has become known to the
church by careful reflection, however, that his
assertion is heretical, he should be condemned as a
