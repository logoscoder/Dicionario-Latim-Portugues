condemnasse opiniones Thomae quia continent
veritatem, quidam autem quia ad eum quamcunque
assertionem damnare minime pertinebat. Quidam vero
dicunt quod rite damnavit quia illae opiniones fidei
obviant orthodoxae, eo quod tota opinio de unitate
formae in homine doctrinae ecclesiae manifeste
repugnat quae docet quod idem fuit corpus Christi
vivum et mortuum. Et quilibet episcopus habet
potestatem damnandi assertiones doctrinae ecclesiae
repugnantes.

Thomas's opinions rashly because they contain the
truth, some, however, because it did not pertain to him
to condemn any opinion at all. But indeed some say
that he condemned them rightly because those
opinions are opposed to orthodox faith in that the
whole opinion about the unity of form in a man is
clearly opposed to the teaching of the church which
teaches that Christ's body was the same alive and
dead. And any bishop at all has the power to condemn
assertions opposed to the teaching of the church.

Capitulum 25

Chapter 25

Discipulus Narra quomodo respondetur ad tertiam
instantiam de Ordine Minorum qui damnauit doctrinam
Petri Iohannis.

Student Tell me how reply is made to the third
objection about the Order of Minorites which
condemned the teaching of Peter John.

Magister Ad illam multipliciter respondetur. Ad cuius
evidentiam debes scire quod de doctrina Petri Iohannis
diversi diversimode sentiunt. Quidam enim putant
totam doctrinam suam esse catholicam. Quidam
aestimant quod nihil in ea invenitur quod haeresim
sapiat manifestam, multa tamen falsa et fantastica
continet et praecipue cum futura praedicit. Alii
reputant quod haereses continet manifestas.

Master There are many replies to this. To make this
clear you should know that different people think
differently about Peter John's teaching. For some
people think that all his teaching is catholic. Some
think that nothing is found in it which smacks of
manifest heresy, yet that it contains many false and
fantastic features, especially when he predicts future
events. Others reckon that it contains manifest
heresies.

Primi et secundi tenent quod Ordo Minorum dictam
doctrinam temerarie condemnavit, immo nonnulli
putant quod damnantes incurrerint haereticam
pravitatem quia sententialiter damnare catholicam
veritatem efficit damnantem haereticum pertinacem.
Tertii variantur, quidam enim licet reputent doctrinam
Petri Iohannis esse haereticam, tamen asserunt quod
Ordo antedictus temere condemnavit eandem
potestatem quam non habuit usurpando. Alii dicunt
quod condemnantes nequaquam temere processerunt
quia processerunt auctoritate papae. Dicunt enim quod
Nicolaus 4 eandem doctrinam mandaverit condemnari.
Tertii dicunt specialiter de capitulo Massiliensi quod
non temere condemnavit praefatam doctrinam quia
solum damnavit, vel potius damnatam declaravit seu
pronunciavit, illa quae prius per concilium generale vel
per aliquem pontificem Romanum damnata fuerunt vel
quae aperte contradicebant Scripturae Divinae.

The first and second groups hold that the Order of
Minorites condemned the said teaching rashly, indeed
some of them think that the condemners fell into
heretical wickedness because to condemn a catholic
truth in a sentence makes the condemner a
pertinacious heretic. The third group is diversified, for
although some of them regard Peter John's teaching as
heretical, yet they assert that the aforesaid Order
condemned it rashly in usurping a power which it did
not have. Others say the condemners did not proceed
rashly because they proceeded with the authority of
the pope. For they say that Nicholas IV ordered that
his teaching be condemned. A third group says about
the chapter at Marseilles in particular that it did not
condemn that teaching rashly because it condemned,
or rather declared or pronounced condemned, only
those things which had been condemned previously
by a general council or by some Roman pontiff or
which were clearly in contradiction with divine
scripture.

Discipulus Ista ultima sententia magis mihi placet pro
eo praecipue quod nec Ordini antedicto attribuit
usurpasse potestatem quam non habuit nec damnationi
domini Iohannis papae 22 noscitur obviare, et ideo
ipsam quantum potes fulcire nitaris.

Student That last opinion pleases me more, especially
because it did not charge that Order with usurping
power which it did not have and because it is not
known to be opposed to the condemnation by the lord,
Pope John XXII, and therefore try to support it as well
as you can.

Magister Istam sententiam declarare non possem nisi

Master I could not make that opinion clear unless I
