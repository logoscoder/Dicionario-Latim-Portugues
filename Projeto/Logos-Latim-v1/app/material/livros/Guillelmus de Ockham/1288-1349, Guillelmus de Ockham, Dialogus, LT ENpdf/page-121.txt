Magister Quartus modus, secundum nonnullos, quo
statim aliquis pertinax et haereticus iudicatur est si quis
Christianus capax rationis et maxime intelligens neget
quamcunque assertionem catholicam quae apud omnes
catholicos et fideles cum quibus conversatus est
tanquam catholica divulgatur et a praedicantibus
verbum Dei publice praedicatur, sicut apud omnes
catholicos publice divulgatur quod Christus fuit
crucifixus, unde et in omni ecclesia crucifixus
ostenditur et praedicantes verbum Dei hoc publice
annuntiant et affirmant; et ideo si quis inter Christianos
nutritus negaret Christum fuisse crucifixum esset statim
pertinax et haereticus iudicandus. Et quanto magis
fuisset inter Christianos conversatus et plures intrasset
ecclesias et verbum Dei a pluribus audivisset et
maiorem literaturam in sacra pagina et iure canonico
haberet, tanto fortius esset statim pertinax et haereticus
iudicandus.

Master The fourth way, some say, by which
someone is immediately judged to be pertinacious and
a heretic is if any Christian, who is capable of reason and, most of all, has understanding - denies any
catholic assertion which is published as catholic
among all the catholics and the faithful with whom he
has been living and is publicly preached by those who
preach the word of God. It is, for instance, widely
published among all catholics that Christ was
crucified - and thus the crucified one is on show in
every church and those who preach the word of God
publicly announce and affirm this fact - and if anyone
brought up among christians, therefore, were to deny
that Christ was crucified, he should be judged
immediately to be pertinacious and a heretic. And the
more that he had lived among christians, the more
churches he had entered, the more expositions of the
word of God he had heard, the more learned he were
to become in the page of scripture and the canon law,
so much the more strongly should he be judged
immediately to be pertinacious and a heretic.

Discipulus Quia quidam, ut scis, ista de causa putant
dominum Iohannem esse haereticum, pro eo videlicet
quod negat animas reproborum esse in inferno et
animas sanctorum in celo videre Deum et daemones
nunc puniri, quas dicunt esse veritates catholicas apud
omnes catholicos divulgatas, unde et dicunt quod
quamvis sermones suos nequaquam bullaverit tamen
est pertinax et haereticus iudicandus, peto quod
praedictum modum de pertinacia convincendi
fortioribus allegationibus munire coneris ut materiam
habeam cogitandi quomodo ad illas et alias pro
defensionem domini nostri summi pontificis valeam
respondere.

Disciple Since, as you know, some people think that
the lord John is a heretic, for the reason that he denies
that the souls of the wicked are in hell, that the souls
of the saints in heaven see God, and that the devils are
even now being punished, which they say are catholic
truths published among all catholics, so also they say
that even though he has not published his words in a
bull he should be judged nevertheless to be
pertinacious and a heretic. I ask you to try to fortify
with stronger arguments that way of convicting of
pertinacity so that I have material for pondering how I
can reply in defence of our lord the the highest pontiff
to those and other [allegations].

Magister Quod negans aliquam assertionem
catholicam apud omnes catholicos divulgatam sit
statim absque alia examinatione vel discussione inter
pertinaces et haereticos computandus ostenditur primo
sic.

Master That someone denying some assertion
published as catholic among all catholics should be
reckoned immediately, without any other questioning
or discussion, among the pertinacious and the heretics
is shown first of all as follows.

Sicut nulli licet ignorare illa quae publice fiunt,
secundum quod ex sacris canonibus colligitur evidenter
dist. 16. Quod dicitis et 12, q. 2, Qui et humanis, sic
nemini licet ignorare ea quae publice divulgantur,
nuntiantur et tanquam catholica praedicantur. Qui
autem negat assertionem catholicam quam sibi ignorare
non licet est pertinax et haereticus iudicandus. Ergo qui
negat assertionem catholicam, tam publice scilicet apud
omnes catholicos divulgatam, est statim pertinax et
haereticus iudicandus.

Just as it is not licit for anyone to be ignorant of those
things which are done publicly -- we clearly gather
this from the sacred canons, dist. 16. Quod dicitis
[col.50; see especially the gloss where the point is
made more clearly] and 12. q. 2. Qui et humanis
[col.695] -- so it is not licit for anyone to be ignorant
of those things which are widely published, affirmed
and preached as catholic. He who denies a catholic
assertion which it is not licit for him to be ignorant of
should be judged to be pertinacious and a heretic. He
who denies a catholic assertion that has been so
widely published, among all catholics that is, should
be immediately judged, therefore, to be pertinacious
and a heretic.
