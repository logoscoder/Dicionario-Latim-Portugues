Extra, De constitutionibus c. ultimo, Quoniam
constitutio, ita papa vel gerens se pro papa diffinitive
pronuntians haereticam assertionem esse tenendam
quantum in ipso est omnes astringit ad eandem
assertionem haereticam irrevocabiliter tenendam et
defendendam. Ergo pertinax et haereticus est
censendus.

statute of the apostolic see binds everyone, as we find
in the last Chapter of Extra. De constitutionibus,
Quoniam constitutio [cols.28-9], so a pope, or one
presenting himself as pope, who pronounces
definitively that a heretical assertion should be held
binds everyone, as much as in him lies, to hold and
defend irrevocably that same assertion. Therefore, he
should be considered pertinacious and heretical.

Secundo sic: ille qui per se vel per alios persequitur,
punit vel molestat catholicam veritatem confitentes et
pravitatem haereticam detestantes est pertinax et
haereticus reputandus. Haec in superioribus est fundata.
Papa autem qui solenniter diffinit aliquam assertionem
quae est haeretica esse tenendam per se et per alios
quantum in ipso est persequitur, punit et molestat
catholicam veritatem contrariam defensantes et
pravitatem heareticam detestantes, cum quantum in ipso
est per suam constitutionem omnes contradicentes
reddat anathemate dignos. Nicolao papa in universali
synodo residente testante qui, ut habetur 25. q. 2. c. Si
quis, ait, "Si quis dogmata, mandata, sanctiones,
interdicta vel pro catholica fide decreta vel ecclesiastica
disciplina pro correctione imminentium vel futurorum
malorum a sedis apostolicae praesule promulgata
contempserit
anathema
sit."
Catholicos
et
contradicentes suae diffinitioni quantum in ipso est
subicit multis aliis poenis, quia praeceptis et
diffinitionibus apostolicis resistentes poenis variis
puniuntur secundum quod ex verbis Gregorii quae
ponuntur dist. 12. c. Praeceptis et dist. 19. c. Nulli et ex
verbis Adriani papae quae recitantur 25. q. 1. c.
Generali et aliis sacris canonibus colligitur evidenter.
Per alios etiam contradicentes catholicos quantum in
ipso est punit, persequitur et molestat, quia quantum in
ipso est inferiores praelatos astringit ut contradicentes
suae assertioni omnibus poenis quas praelati debent
inobedientibus mandatis apostolicis mandatis infligere
plectant. Igitur talis gerens se pro papa pertinax et
haereticus est censendus.

[It is proved] second as follows. [See Significant
Variants, para. 25.] He who himself or through others
persecutes, punishes or molests those confessing
catholic truth and denouncing heretical wickedness
should be regarded as pertinacious and heretical - this
is based on what was said above. A pope who solemnly
pronounces that some assertion which is heretical
should be held, however, is, as far as in him lies, by
himself and through others persecuting, punishing and
molesting those defending the opposing catholic truth
and those denouncing heretical wickedness, since by
his statute he makes all those who contradict him in
this respect worthy of anathema. Pope Nicholas attests
to this at a sitting of a universal synod when he says, as
we find in 25, q. 2, c [18] Si quis, "If anyone defies
decrees, mandates, resolutions, interdicts, or
pronouncements which have been promulgated by the
head of the apostolic see on behalf of catholic faith or
ecclesiastical discipline for the correction of imminent
or future evils, let him be anathema." [col.1451] As far
as in him lies, [such a pope] subjects catholics
contradicting his definition to many other penalties too,
because those opposing apostolic commands and
pronouncements are punished with various penalties, as
we clearly gather from the words of Gregory found in
dist. 12. c.[2] Preceptis [col.41] and dist. 19. c.[5] Nulli
[col.83] and from the words of Pope Hadrian recorded
in 25, q. 1, c. [11] Generali [col.1441] and from other
sacred canons. As far as in him lies he punishes,
persecutes and molests catholics who contradict him by
means of others too, because as far as he can he obliges
lesser prelates to punish those who contradict his
assertion with all the penalties which prelates ought to
inflict on those who disobey apostolic commands.
Someone like this who presents himself as pope,
therefore, should be considered pertinacious and
heretical.

Tertio sic: ille errans contra fidem est pertinax et
haereticus reputandus qui facto vel verbo protestatur se
nolle corrigi per illos quorum interest, quia talis non est
paratus corrigi, et per consequens pertinax et haereticus
est censendus. Qui autem gerit se pro papa et solenniter
haeresim diffinit esse tenendam facto protestatur et
etiam verbis se nolle corrigi per concilium generale ad
quod tamen spectat et papam de haeresi emendare. Ergo
pertinax et haereticus est censendus. Maior est

[It is proved] third as follows. He who errs against the
faith should be regarded as pertinacious and heretical if
he bears witness by deed or word that he is not willing
to be corrected by those whose concern it is, because
such a person is not ready to be corrected and should
be considered, as a consequence, pertinacious and
heretical. He who presents himself as pope and
solemnly pronounces that a heresy should be held,
however, bears witness by his act and by his words too
