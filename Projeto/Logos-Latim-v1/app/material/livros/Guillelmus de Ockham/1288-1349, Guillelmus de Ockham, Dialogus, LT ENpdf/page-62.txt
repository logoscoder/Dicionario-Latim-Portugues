Discipulus De hoc postea perscrutabor, et ideo ad
propositum revertere principale et dic an aliqui alii
praeter archiepiscopum de quo dixisti censuerint fuisse
temerariam damnationem praedictam.

Student I will investigate this later, and so return to
the main argument and say whether anyone else
besides the archbishop you spoke about [i.e. Peter of
Conflans] considered that the aforesaid condemnation
was rash.

Magister Plures alii ipsam fuisse temerariam
reputarunt. Plures enim doctores et scholares
Parisienses assertiones damnatas a dicto archiepiscopo
publice tenuerunt. Nam opinionem Thomae de unitate
formae in homine inter alias condemnavit, et tamen tu
scis quod plures Parisius ipsam publice tenent et
defendunt ac docent, et ita est de multis aliis.

Master Many others reckoned that it was rash. For
many doctors and students at Paris publicly held the
assertions condemned by the said archbishop [i.e.
Robert of Kilwardby]. For among other opinions of
Thomas, he condemned the one about the unity of
form in a man, and yet you know that many people in
Paris publicly hold, defend, and teach it; and so it is
with many others.

Discipulus Dic aliam responsionem ad instantiam
secundam.

Student Tell me another response to the second
objection.

Magister Alii dicunt quod dictus archiepiscopus
articulos illos temere condemnavit non quia inter illos
veritates aliquae sint damnatae sed quia sibi potestatem
damnandi quam non habuit usurpavit.

Master Others say that the said archbishop
condemned those articles rashly not because among
them some truths were condemned but because he
usurped to himself a power of condemning that he did
not have.

Discipulus Isti reprehendendo dictam damnationem
primo fundamento solummodo, scilicet quod nullus
inferior summo pontifice habet potestatem aliquam
assertionem tanquam haereticam condemnandi, inniti
videntur.

Student In censuring his condemnation they seem to
be relying on this one principle only, namely that no
one inferior to the highest pontiff has the power to
condemn any assertion as heretical.

Magister Non est, ut dicis, quia isti non solum
innituntur fundamento praefato, sed etiam asserunt
quod assertiones pure philosophicae quae ad
theologiam non pertinent non sunt ab aliquo solenniter
condemnandae seu interdicendae, quia in talibus
quilibet esse debet liber ut libere dicat quid sibi placet;
et ideo quia dictus archiepiscopus damnavit et
interdixit opiniones grammaticales, logicales et pure
philosophicas sua sententia fuit temeraria reputanda.

Master It is not as you say, because they do not rely
only on the aforesaid principle, but they also affirm
that purely philosophical assertions which do not
pertain to theology should not be solemnly
condemned or forbidden by anyone, because in
connection with such [assertions] anyone at all ought
to be free to say freely what pleases him; and
therefore because the said archbishop condemned and
forbad grammatical, logical and purely philosophical
opinions his sentence should be regarded as rash.

Discipulus An liceat alicui tales assertiones damnare
nolo ad praesens inquirere, sed indica si ad saepe
dictam instantiam aliter respondetur.

Student I do not want to inquire now whether anyone
is permitted to condemn such assertions, but indicate
if any other reply is made to the often-cited objection.

Magister Sunt quidam dicentes quod quilibet
episcopus habet potestatem damnandi haereses, ex quo
sibi patenter innotescit quod fidei obviant orthodoxae.

Master Some people say that any bishop has the
power to condemn heresies from the fact that it is
clear to him that they are opposed to orthodox faith.

Discipulus Isti negant quod prius probasti, scilicet
quod sola apostolica sedes potest terminare
quaestionem motam de fide. Unde non curo quod plus
loquaris de isto archiepiscopo, sed dic quid dicitur de
alio.

Student They deny what you proved before, that is,
that only the apostolic see can determine a question
raised about faith. Therefore I do not care for you to
speak further about that archbishop, but set out what is
said about the other one [i.e. John Pecham].
