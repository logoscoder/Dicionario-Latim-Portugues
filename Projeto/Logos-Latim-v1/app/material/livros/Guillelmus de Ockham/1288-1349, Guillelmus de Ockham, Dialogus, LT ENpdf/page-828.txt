the college before they have recourse when
it is not necessary to a judge outside their
college. In the same way, in order to avoid
scandals and many unsuitable events
monks could arrange among themselves, if
one monk were to have a case against
another or one monastery against another,
to come to an agreement before they came
before the bishop's judgement, if they
could, and, if they could not agree without
a judgement, to treat the case before some
monks set up as judges or chosen by the
parties or the college before they had
recourse to the bishop's judgement. Once
this was arranged, monks who abandoned
the judgement of the monks and
indiscriminately, maliciously or
scandalously had recourse to the judgement
of bishops should deservedly be censured,
although those who had recourse to a
bishop's judgement by force of necessity or
for a rational cause should not be rebuked
but in some cases praised. In response to
the case proposed it is said that the apostle
decided that some Corinthians had
abandoned the believing judges who had
been set up or should have been set up for
bringing cases between the faithful to an
end and were wanting indiscriminately,
maliciously and scandalously to be judged
by unbelievers without their being any
necessity or utility in this, and it was these
the apostle rebuked, not those, if there were
any, who were wanting licitly to be judged
by unbelievers, compelled either by their
opponents or by their wish not to prejudice
the authority of unbelievers. So it was that
Paul himself did not flee from the
judgement of Caesar but said, as we read in
Acts 25:10-11, "I am appealing to the
emperor's tribunal; this is where I should be
tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as
you very well know. Now if I am in the
wrong or have committed something for
which I deserve to die, I am not trying to
escape death; but if there is nothing to their
charges against me, no one can turn me
over to them. I appeal to the emperor."
