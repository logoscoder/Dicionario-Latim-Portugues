Ad Glossam autem {om. &Md} {sic ante &Pz}
adductam dupliciter respondetur. Uno modo
quod Iulianus tolerabatur verus imperator ab
ecclesia et non habens imperium verum sed
{*verum sed: om. &MdMzNaPeRe} solum
{*solummodo &MzNaPeRe} usurpatum. Aliter
dicitur quod glossator ibi non habuit {trs.231
&Md} memoriam rerum gestarum tempore
Iuliani, quia Iulianus, ut legitur in diversis
scripturis autenticis, suscitavit scandalum quod
potuit adversus Christianos {*et ideo non
toleravit eum ecclesia ne sucitaret scandalum
adversus christianos add. &NaRe} Sed ecclesia
{*om. &MdNaPeRe} toleravit eum qui {*quia
&MdMzNaPePzRe} non potuit eum {om. &Md}
de facto {*trs.45123 &NaRe} {ecclesia eum add.
&Md} privare imperio {officio imperii &Md}.
Et si per sententiam privasset, iam {*illa privatio
&MdNaPeRe} primo {*om. &MdNaPeRe} non
profuisset {processisset &MdPe} sed nocuisset
ecclesiae.

Now it is replied in two ways to the gloss
adduced: in one way that Julian was
tolerated by the church as a true emperor
and not as one having only a usurped
empire. It is said otherwise that at that
point the glossator had no memory of
things done in the time of Julian, because,
as we read in various authentic writings,
Julian stirred up what hatred he could
against the christians, and the church,
therefore, did not tolerate him so that he
would not stir up hatred against
christians. But it tolerated him because it
could not in fact deprive him of the
empire. And if by its judgement it had
deprived him, that deprivation would
have harmed the church, not profited it.

Discipulus Aliqua {*alia add. &MzNaRe} dicta
maiorum pro eadem assertione adducas.

Student Would you bring forward some
other sayings of our forefathers for the
same assertion.

Magister Hoc ex Legenda sancti Mauritii et
sociorum {et sociorum: sociorumque &Mz} eius
colligitur in qua leguntur sic dixisse {trs.
&MdMzPe}, "Milites sumus imperator
{imperatoris &Pe} tui sed {servi &Md}
[[margin]] tamen servi {om. &Mz} quem {*quod
&MdMzNaPeRe} libere confitemur Dei {deo
&Mz}. Tibi debemus militiam {*trs. &MzNaRe}
sed illi {sed illi: illi autem &Mz} innocentiam."
Et {*tamen add. &MzNaRe} ille {iste &MdMz}
{om. &Pe} imperator, scilicet Maximianus,
extitit {fuit &Mz} infidelis {fidelis &Mz}.

Master We gather this from the legend of
St. Mauritius and his companions, in
which we read that they said the
following: "We are your soldiers, O
emperor, but yet we are slaves because
we freely confess God. We owe you
military service, but we owe him our
innocence." And yet that emperor, that is
Maximianus, was an unbeliever.

Item {et add. &Md} Paulus et Iohannes, ut
legitur in Legenda eorum {*ipsorum
&MzNaRe}, dixerunt Iuliano apostatae, "Non
faciemus {*facimus &MdNaRe} tibi hanc
iniuriam ut praeponamus tibi qualemcunque

Again, as we read in their Legend, Paul
and John said to Julian the Apostate, "We
do not do this injury to you in order to put
any person at all, that is a secular lord,
before you, but we put him who made
