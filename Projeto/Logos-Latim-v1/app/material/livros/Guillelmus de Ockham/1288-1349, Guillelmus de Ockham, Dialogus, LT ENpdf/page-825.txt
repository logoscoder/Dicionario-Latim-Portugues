igitur {*ergo &MzNaRe} salvator quod
peccatum delinquentis post secretam

diceretur {dividetur &Mz} alicui {alteri &Mz}

sacred canons. The Saviour meant,
therefore, that after solitary correction and
the summoning of witnesses the sin of a
transgressor was to be told finally to some
gathering of believers, lay or clerical or
both at the same time. If he were not to
listen to this, he would be held to be like a
Gentile and tax collector.

Aliter dicitur quod {om. &Re} per illa
{*eadem &MzNaPeRe} verba ecclesiae nulla
{*trs. &NaRe} datur {*tribuitur &MzNaPeRe}
potestas puniendi peccantes sed solummodo
attribuitur {*tribuitur &MzNaRe} {potestas ...
attribuitur om. &Pe} ei {*sibi &MzNaPeRe}
potestas corrigendi {*corripiendi &NaPeRe}
absque punitione aliqua {*alia &NaRe}. Nam
per illa {*eadem &MzNaPeRe} verba nihil
plus attribuitur {*tribuitur &MzNaPeRe}
ecclesiae quam fratri in quem {*in quem: inquit
&Mz} peccatur et testibus adhibitis. Sicut enim
dicitur, "Si te non audierit, adhibe tecum adhuc
unum vel duos", testes {*om. &NaRe} et sicut
dicitur, {*"Quod add. &MzNaRe} si illos non
audierit, {adhibe ... audierit om. &Pe} de {*dic
&MzNaPeRe} ecclesiae", ita dicitur, et {*om.
&NaRe} "Si {*autem add. &NaReVg}
ecclesiam non audierit sit tibi {sibi add. &Na}
sicut Ethnicus et publicanus." Per quae verba
innuitur quod ultimo debet facere ecclesia illud
{*om. &NaRe} quod prius fecit frater {fratri
&Mz} in quem {in quem: inquantum &Mz}
spectabatur {*peccabatur &MzNaPeRe} et
quod fecerunt {fecerit &Mz} testes adhibiti.
Quo facto ille in quem peccatur debet ipsum
{*habere &MzNaPeRe} peccantem
{potestatem &MzNa} reputare {*om.
&MzNaPeRe} {*sicut add. &MzNaRe}
{contra add. &Mz} Ethnicum et publicanum,
quia ibi {*illi &Na} dicitur, "Sit tibi sicut
Ethnicus et publicanus", hoc est, {*vel add.
&NaPe} vita {vel evites &Mz} eum sicut
ethnicum et publicanum {quia ibi ...
publicanum om. &Re} {*vel add. &NaRe},

In another way it is said that no power to
punish sinners is given to the church by
those words, but only the power to reprove,
without any other punishment, is given to
it. For nothing more is given to the church
by those words than to a brother who is
sinned against and to summoned witnesses.
For just as it is said, "If you are not listened
to, take one or two others along with you",
and "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to
the church", so it is said, "If he refuses to
listen even to the church, let him be to you
as a Gentile and a tax collector." These
words mean that the church ought to do
finally what the brother who was sinned
against did first and what the summoned
witnesses did. Once this has been done, he
who was sinned against should consider the
sinner as a Gentile and tax collector,
because to him it is said, "Let him be to you
as a Gentile and a tax collector", that is,
either avoid him as a Gentile and tax
collector, or, out of a love of justice and on
account of the common good and so that
the good may live quietly among the evil,
hand him over to a judge who will ensure
the execution of justice concerning him.
But those words of the Saviour do not give
to the brother who is sinned against nor to
the summoned witnesses the power to
punish a transgressing brother, but only to
reprove him. By those same words,
therefore, the church is given power only to
reprove a transgressor.
