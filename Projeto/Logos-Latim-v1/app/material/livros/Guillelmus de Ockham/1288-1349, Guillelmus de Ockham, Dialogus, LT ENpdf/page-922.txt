&NaPeRe} vel aliqui eorum redeant ad
catholicam fidem et omnes alii efficiantur
haeretici. Tunc quaeritur an isti cardinales
redeuntes de haeresi habent ius eligendi aut
non habent. Si habent ergo recuperaverunt ius
eligendi absque nova collatione eiusdem iuris
eo ipso quod redierunt ad orthodoxam fidem.
Si non habent ius eligendi et non sunt alii
catholici per casum illum ergo tota ecclesia
Dei caret {*careret &NaPeRe} iure eligendi

that the cardinals become heretics and later
all or some of them return to the catholic faith
while all others become heretics. Then it is
asked whether or not the cardinals returning
from heresy have the right to elect. If they do
have [the right], they have therefore
recovered the right to elect without that right
being conferred anew because they have
returned to orthodox faith. If they do not have
the right to elect and there are no other
catholics in that situation, the whole church
of God would as a result lack the right to
elect the supreme pontiff.

Magister Respondetur ad hoc quod cardinales
ius eligendi quod habent ex ordinatione
humana, puta ex concessione Papae vel
romanorum, in nullo casu recuperant eo ipso
quod revertuntur ad fidem {catholicam add.
&Pe} absque nova collatione eiusdem iuris et
sic intelliguntur illa quae prius dicta sunt de
hoc. Sed ius eligendi quod competit eis ex
ordinatione Christi possunt, saltem in casu
quando {quo &Pe} non essent alii catholici,
recuperare eo ipso quod redirent ad veram
fidem.

Master The reply to this is that in no case,
without that right being conferred anew,
would cardinals recover a right to elect which
they have by human decree, for example by a
grant from the pope or from the Romans,
because of the fact that they return to the
faith; and what was said above about this is
understood in that sense. But a right to elect
which belongs to them by Christ's decree they
can recover because of the fact that they
returned to the true faith, at least in the case
where there were no other catholics.

Discipulus Quare plus recuperant ius eligendi
quod habent ex ordinatione Christi eo ipso
quod redeunt {redeant &Pe} ab {de &Pe}
haeresi ad catholicam fidem quam {illud add.
&Pe} ius quod non {*om. &NaMzPeRe}
habent nisi {*om. &NaMzPeRe} ex
ordinatione humana?

Student Why do they recover a right to elect
which they have by Christ's decree because of
the fact that they return from heresy to the
Christian faith more than a right which they
have by human decree?

Magister Huiusmodi {huius &Pe} ratio
assignatur: quia ab eodem est {*debet &NaRe}
idem {*om. &NaRe} ius primo esse {om.
&Pe} collatum et post {om. &Pe} amissionem
{amissioni &Pe} restitutum; et ideo quia
Christus ordinavit et promisit quod nullum
unquam necessarium {*trs. &NaRe} deficeret
ecclesiae suae, ideo ordinavit quod haeretici in
tali casu quando non sunt alii catholici eo ipso
quod redeunt ad {catholicam add. &Pe} fidem
restituatur eis ius eligendi. Sed per {secundum
&Pe} nullam ordinationem humanam habetur

Master The following reason is offered:
because a right should first be conferred and
restored after its loss by the same person; and
therefore because Christ decreed and
promised that his church would never lack
anything necessary, he did as a result decree
that in the sort of case where there are no
other catholics the right to elect is restored to
heretics because of the fact that they return to
the faith. But we do not find in any human
decree that cardinals who become heretics
would recover the right to elect because of
