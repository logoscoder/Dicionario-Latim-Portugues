aliquid secundum quod homo in hac veritate a
Scriptura Divina accepta, "Christus est verus Deus et
homo", se fundavit. Sic etiam sancti doctores haereses
reprobando ipsas per Scripturas Sacras convincere
conabantur, sicut ex libris eorum patenter habetur.
Unde et Isidorus, ut habetur 24, q. 3, c. Quidam autem,
plures haereses per Scripturam Sacram arguit
evidenter.

the assertion that says that Christ is nothing as a man
Alexander III based himself on this truth taken from
divine scripture, "Christ is true God and true man". So
too, when refuting heresies holy doctors tried to
convict them through the sacred scriptures, as is
clearly found from their books. Hence, as we find in
24, q. 3, c. Quidam autem [col.1001], Isidore too
clearly censured many heresies through sacred
scripture.

Secundum fundamentum est doctrina apostolica, quae
in scriptis apostolicis non redacta sed relatione
succedentium fidelium vel in scripturis fide dignis ad
nos pervenit, et isti fundamento innititur Nicolaus papa
qui, ut ex capitulo eius in decretis dist. 22 inserto
patenter colligitur, diffinit haereticum fore censendum
dicere Romanam ecclesiam non esse caput omnium
ecclesiarum. Cum tamen de hoc in Scripturis Sacris
mentio minime habeatur sed hoc apostoli tradiderunt et
docuerunt fideles, quae doctrina relatione fidelium
sibimet succedentium et scripturis sanctorum patrum
ad nos pervenit. Pro hoc faciunt rationes ac auctoritates
quas supra, cum tractarem interrogationem tuam quae
veritates sunt catholicae reputandae, adduxi.

The second principle is apostolic teaching, which has
reached us not rendered in apostolic writings but by
the account of succeeding believers or in trustworthy
writings. As we clearly gather from his Chapter
inserted in dist. 22 [c. Omnes, col.73], Pope Nicholas
relies on this principle when he determines that it
should be considered heretical to say that the Roman
church is not the head of all churches. Yet since no
mention is found of this in the sacred scriptures, rather
the apostles handed this on and taught it to believers,
this teaching has reached us in the account of the
believers who followed them and in the writings of
the holy fathers. The arguments and texts which I
brought forward above when I was investigating your
question, "Which truths should be regarded as
catholic?" tell in favour of this.

Tertium fundamentum est revelatio vel inspiratio nova
divina. Si enim aliqua veritas aeterna de his quae
pertinent ad salutem de novo revelaretur ecclesiae, illa
esset tanquam catholica approbanda et omnem
falsitatem ei contrariam posset ecclesia et etiam papa
tanquam haereticam condemnare. Et quamvis isti
exemplum nesciant invenire, quod unquam ecclesia
aliquam haeresim condemnando se in tali revelatione
vel inspiratione fundaverit, tamen dicunt quod hoc non
est impossibile quia posset Deus, si sibi placeret,
multas veritates catholicas noviter revelare vel
inspirare.

The third principle is a new divine revelation or
inspiration. For if any eternal truth about those things
that pertain to salvation were newly revealed to the
church it would be approved as catholic, and the
church, and also the pope, could condemn as heretical
every falsity opposed to it. And although they do not
know how to find an example, that in condemning
some heresy the church has ever based itself on such a
revelation or inspiration, yet they say that this is not
impossible because if it were pleasing to him God
could newly reveal or inspire many catholic truths.

Discipulus Quid si papa vel generale etiam concilium
dicat sibi aliquam veritatem esse revelatam a Deo vel
etiam inspiratam? Nunquid alii fideles credere
astringuntur?

Student What if a pope or even a general council says
that some truth had been revealed to it, or, also,
inspired in it, by God? Are other believers bound to
believe?

Magister Dicunt isti quod absque miraculo manifesto
non est eis credendum quia non sufficit nude asserere
quod est eis veritas revelata vel etiam inspirata, sed
oportet quod talem revelationem seu inspirationem
miraculi operatione confirment aperta.

Master They say that they should not be believed
without an obvious miracle, because it is not enough
to assert barely that a truth has been revealed to them
or even inspired in them, but it is necessary that they
confirm a revelation or inspiration of this kind by the
clear working of a miracle.

Discipulus Quid dicerent isti si omnes christiani nullo
excepto aliquam veritatem tanquam catholicam firmiter
acceptarent quam tamen nec ex Scripturis Divinis nec
ex aliqua doctrina ecclesiae praecedenti possent
ostendere?

Student What would they say if all christians with no
exception were firmly to accept some truth as catholic
which nevertheless they could not show from the
divine scriptures nor from any earlier teaching of the
church?
