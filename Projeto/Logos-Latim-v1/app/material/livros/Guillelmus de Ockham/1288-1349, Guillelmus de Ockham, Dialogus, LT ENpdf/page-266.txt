multitudo usum racionis habencium que non est
confirmata in gracia potest peccare. Tota autem
multitudo Christianorum non est confirmata in fide,
quia nullus Christianus in hac vita est confirmatus in
fide. Ergo multo forcius tota multitudo non est
confirmata in fide. Ergo tota potest contra fidem errare.

faith, just as that multitude of those who have the use
of reason which has not been confirmed in grace can
sin. The whole multitude of Christians, however, has
not been confirmed in faith because no Christian has
been confirmed in faith in this life. A fortiori,
therefore, the whole multitude has not been
confirmed in faith. Therefore the whole can err
against faith.

Tercia racio est hec. Illa multitudo quando est sola
potest contra fidem errare que valet errare contra fidem
postquam alii sunt sibi adiuncti, per quos nichil
necessario bonitatis aut virtutis sibi diminuitur sed
magis accrescit, quia eadem multitudo est forcior cum
aliis sibi conferentibus quam sola; sed tota multitudo
Christianorum que nunc est, si ipsa manente integra
nullo ex ea penitus pereunte, postquam multi alii effecti
fuerint Christiani ac sacerdotes et episcopi, poterit
contra fidem errare. Ergo eadem multitudo, si sola
remanserit nullo alio effecto Christiano, antequam
aliquis alius fidem susceperit, poterit contra fidem
errare. Et ita hec est possibilis: tota multitudo
Christianorum errat contra fidem.

A third argument is this. That multitude can err
against faith when it is alone which can err against
faith when others, by whom none of its goodness or
virtue is necessarily decreased but rather increased,
have been added to it, because the same multitude is
stronger with the others joining it than alone; but if
the whole multitude of Christians which now exists
remains complete, with no one at all from among it
dying, it will be able to err in faith after many others
have become Christians and priests and bishops;
therefore if the same multitude remains alone, with
no one else becoming Christian, it will be able to err
against faith before anyone else receives the faith.
And so this is possible: the whole multitude of
Christians errs against faith.

Quarta racio est hec. Nulla auctoritate videtur posse
probari quin possibile sit omnes Christianos preter duos
episcopos contra fidem errare, quia omnes promissiones
Christi de fide usque ad finem seculi duratura salvari
possunt si omni tempore ad minus duo episcopi
catholici fuerint et fideles. Ponatur ergo quod omnes
Christiani heretici efficiantur preter duos episcopos; quo
posito, probatur quod illi duo episcopi, antequam aliquis
alius efficiatur catholicus, possunt contra fidem errare.
Quod ostenditur primo sic: neuter illorum est tunc
confirmatus in fide; ergo uterque illorum potest contra
fidem errare. Secundo sic: non maior cura esset Deo de
illis duobus episcopis eo quod essent soli fideles quam
fuit de primis duobus parentibus quando erant soli
fideles. Sed primi parentes quando erant soli potuissent
contra fidem errare. Ergo et illi episcopi possent contra
fidem errare.

A fourth argument is this. It does not seem provable
by any authoritative text that it is not possible for all
Christians apart from two bishops to err against faith,
because all Christ's promises about faith lasting to the
end of the age can be preserved if there are at any
time at least two catholic and faithful bishops. Let it
be assumed, therefore, that all Christians become
heretics except for two bishops. With this assumed it
is proved that those two bishops can err against faith
before anyone else becomes a catholic. This is shown
firstly thus: neither of them has been confirmed in
faith at the time; therefore either of them can err
against faith. [It is shown] secondly thus: God would
not have a greater care for those two bishops because
they would be the only believers, than he had for our
two first parents when they were the only believers;
but our first parents could have erred against faith
when they were alone; therefore those bishops too
would be able to err against faith.

Quinta racio probat specialiter quod tota multitudo
Christianorum virorum et mulierum usum racionis
habencium potest contra fidem errare, quia tota illa
multitudo potest contra fidem errare qua errante
salvantur omnes promissiones Christi de fide usque ad
consummacionem seculi permansura. Sed, errante tota
multitudine Christianorum virorum ac mulierum usum
racionis habencium, possunt salvari promissiones
Christi de fide mansura. Nam Christus vere est
spiritualiter cum parvulis baptizatis per graciam et
virtutes. Fides eciam beati Petri pro qua Christus rogavit
nequaquam deficeret quia reperiretur in parvulis.

A fifth argument proves particularly that the whole
multitude of Christian men and women who have use
of reason can err against faith because that whole
multitude can err against faith if all Christ's promises
about faith lasting to the end of the age are kept
despite their erring. But if the whole multitude of
Christian men and women who have the use of
reason err, Christ's promises about the faith persisting
can be kept. For spiritually Christ is truly with
baptised infants through grace and virtues. And so
Peter's faith, for which Christ asked, would not fail
because it would be found in infants. For infants have
