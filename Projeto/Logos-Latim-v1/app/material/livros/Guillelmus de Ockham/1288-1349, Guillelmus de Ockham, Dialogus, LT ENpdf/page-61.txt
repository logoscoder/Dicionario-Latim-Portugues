highest pontiff.
Discipulus Si tam damnans solenniter assertionem
catholicam quam revocans ritam et iustam
damnationem haereticae pravitatis sit iudicandus
haereticus, de quo inferius interrogationes tibi
proponam, videtur necessario concedendum vel
ferentes dictam sententiam excommunicationis contra
opiniones Thomae vel postea revocantes eandem sunt
inter haereticos computandi.

Student If both someone condemning solemnly a
catholic assertion and someone revoking a right and
just condemnation of heretical wickedness should be
judged heretical - and I will propose some questions
to you about this later - it seems that it should be
granted necessarily that either those imposing the said
sentence of excommunication against the opinions of
Thomas or those revoking it later should be reckoned
among the heretics.

Magister Quibusdam videtur quod tantum ferentes,
aliis quod revocantes sunt haeretici reputandi, sed qui
verius dicant sciri non potest nisi praecognito an
assertiones damnatae et postea revocatae haereticae vel
catholicae sint censendae.

Master It seems to some people that only the
sentencers, to others [only] the revokers are be
regarded as heretics, but it can not be known who is
speaking more truly unless it is first known whether
the assertions condemned and later revoked should be
considered heretical or catholic.

Capitulum 24

Chapter 24

Discipulus De ista instantia ad praesens te non amplius
intromittas, sed dic quomodo ad secundam instantiam
respondetur.

Student Do not involve yourself any further with that
objection now, but tell me how reply is made to the
second objection.

Magister Instantia illa comprehendit duas, quarum
prima est de primo archiepiscopo qui fuit Ordinis
Praedicatorum. Secunda est de secundo archiepiscopo
qui fuit Ordinis Minorum. De primo diversimode
dicitur a diversis. Dicunt enim quidam quod damnatio
sua temeraria existebat eo quod veritates, ut dicunt,
condemnavit. Unde et quidam alius archiepiscopus
ipsum de dicta damnatione acriter reprehendit, scribens
eidem epistolam in qua manifeste asseruit quod
veritates damnaverat. Multi tamen putantes ipsum
veritates plures temere condemnasse quod fuerit
haereticus nequaquam affirmant, quia, ut dicunt,
nullam veritatem catholicam sed plures veritates
philosophicas condemnavit. De assertionibus enim
grammaticalibus, logicalibus et pure philosophicis in
eadem damnatione se, ut asserunt, temere intromisit.

Master That objection comprises two [parts], of
which the first concerns the first archbishop who was
of the Order of Preachers. The second concerns the
second archbishop who was of the Order of Minorites.
Different people speak in different ways about the
first. For some say that his condemnation was rash in
that he condemned what they say are truths. Thus also
a certain other archbishop [Peter of Conflans]
censured him fiercely for that condemnation, writing a
letter to him in which he clearly affirmed that he had
condemned truths. Yet many people who think that he
rashly condemned many truths do not assert that he
was a heretic because, as they say, he did not
condemn any catholic truth but many philosophical
truths. For they affirm that in that condemnation he
rashly involved himself with grammatical, logical and
purely philosophical assertions.

Discipulus An iste propter dictam damnationem fuerit
haereticus reputandus vel non sciri non posset nisi
assertiones discuterentur quas damnavit, quod ad
praesens non intendo. Sed posito quod damnasset
aliquam assertionem quae in rei veritate est pure
philosophica tanquam haereticam, nunquid fuisset
haereticus?

Student Whether he should have been regarded as a
heretic or not because of that condemnation could not
be known unless the assertions which he condemned
were discussed, and I do not intend to do this now.
But if it is assumed that he had condemned some
assertion as heretical which in truth of fact is purely
philosophical, would he have been a heretic?

Magister Quidam dicunt quod sic, quia pertinaciter
asserens aliquid esse de substantia fidei quod ad fidem
non pertinet est haereticus iudicandus.

Master Some people say 'yes', because someone who
affirms pertinaciously that something which does not
pertain to the faith concerns the substance of faith
should be judged a heretic.
