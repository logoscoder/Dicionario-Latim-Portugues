magis revertitur ad illum penes quem
remanserat {*remanserit &NaPe} {remansit
&Re} dominium rei ratione cuius erat
patronus.

with the corporation, much more is it the case
that it reverts to him in whose power the
lordship of the possession, with respect to
which he was patron, has remained.

Item dignitates ecclesiae {om. &NaRe} per
haereticam pravitatem amissae recuperantur
absque nova electione {*collatione &PeRe}.
Ergo et iura spiritualia propter haereticam
pravitatem amissa recuperari poterunt absque
nova {electione ... nova om. &Na} collatione
eorundem iurium. Consequentia videtur aperta
{aperte &Re} quia eadem ratio videtur {*est
&NaRe} de uno et de alio.

Again, dignities of the church lost by
heretical wickedness are recovered without
being conferred anew. Therefore spiritual
rights lost on account of heretical wickedness
will also be able to be recovered without
those rights being conferred anew. The
consequence seems clear because the same
argument applies to the one as to the other.

Antecedens auctoritatibus manifestis videtur
posse probari. Ait enim Augustinus, ut habetur
23. q. 4. c. Ipsa pietas, loquens de Donatistis
haereticis {loquens de Donatistis hereticis om.
&NaRe}, "Habeant ergo {om. &NaMzPeRe}
de praeterito detestabili errore, sicut Petrus
habuit de mendacii timore, amarum dolorem,
et veniant {et veniant: inveniant &Re} ad
ecclesiam Christi veram, id est catholicam
matrem: sint {sunt &Pe} {sicut &NaRe} in illa
clerici, sint {sicut &NaRe} in illa {*in illa om.
&NaReZn} episcopi utiliter {om. &Na}
{utilem &Pe}, qui contra eam fuerunt {fuerint
&Pe} hostiliter. Non invidemus {videmus
&Re}, imo amplectimur, hortamur, optamus."
religiosissime {*om. &NaRe}
{religiosissimum &Pe}

Item ex sexta Synodo, ut legitur 1, q. 7, c.
Convenientibus, sic habetur, "Religiosissimi
monachi dixerunt, `Sicut receperunt {sicut
receperunt om. &Pe} universales {universalem
&Pe} sex {trs. &MzNaPeRe} synodi ab
haeresi revertentes, ita et nos recepimus
{*recipimus &NaMzPeZn}.' Sancta {sexta
&Pe} synodus dixit, `Placet omnibus nobis et
iussi sunt Basilius episcopus Anichirii
{*Anichire &NaMzPeReZn} et Theodorus
episcopus Mireae civitatis et Theodosius
sedere {sedentes &Pe} in gradibus et sedibus
suis.'" Et infra, "Constantinus episcopus Cypri

The antecedent seems provable by plain texts.
(1) For as we find in 23, q. 4, c. Ipsa pietas
[c.24, col.909], Augustine, speaking about
the Donatist heretics, says, "Let them
therefore have bitter grief about their
aforesaid detestable error, as Peter had about
his fear of untruth, and let them come to the
true church of Christ, that is our catholic
mother; let them be clerics in her, let them to
her advantage be bishops, they who were like
an enemy to her. We do not refuse them,
rather we embrace, encourage and desire
them."

Again, (2) as we read in 1, q. 7, c.
Convenientibus [c.4, cols.428], we find the
following from the sixth synod, "Most devout
monks have said, `Just as all six synods have
accepted those who turn back from heresy, so
we also accept them.' The holy synod has
said, `It pleases all of us and Basil, bishop of
Anichira, Theodorus, bishop of the city of
Mirea, and Theodosius, bishop of Amorius,
have ordered them to remain in their grades
and their sees. ... Constantinus, bishop of
Cyprus said, `It has been adequately shown
that those coming back from heretics should
