Discipulus Quomodo potest hoc stare quod Christus
potestatem corripiendi in foro ecclesie solummodo
commiserit ecclesie, cum tamen Apostolus Paulus
Corinthium excommunicaverit et 1 ad Timotheum primo
asserit se quosdam Sathane tradidisse?

Student: How can it be valid that Christ committed
the power of correcting in the forum of the church
only to the church when the apostle Paul
excommunicated a Corinthian and affirms in 1
Timothy 1[:20] that he handed some people over to
Satan?

Magister Ad hoc respondetur quod ex commissione
Christi sola communitas fidelium habuit potestatem
corripiendi in foro ecclesie. Christus tamen non artavit
communitatem fidelium ad certum modum corripiendi,
quin scilicet posset per se totam, quando esset expediens,
vel per aliquam singularem personam que gereret vicem
communitatis corrigere delinquentes; et ideo communitas
poterat potestatem corripiendi committere determinate
persone, et ita dicunt beatum Paulum potestatem
corrigendi accepisse a communitate fidelium unius
provincie vel diversarum provinciarum.

[See Significant Variants, para. 34.]Master: The
reply to this is that by Christ's commission only the
community of believers had the power of correcting
in the forum of the church. Nevertheless Christ did
not limit the community of believers to a fixed way
of correcting, so that it could not correct those at
fault itself as a whole, when it was convenient, or
through some particular person who would act as the
community's representative. And therefore the
community could commit the power of correcting to
a person it decided on, and it was in this way, they
say, that blessed Paul received the power of
correcting from the community of believers in one
province or in various provinces.

Discipulus Secundum hoc sequitur quod Christus non
reliquit aliquod caput ecclesie.

Student: According to this it follows that Christ did
not leave any head for the church.

Magister Concedunt isti quod Christus non reliquit
caput ecclesie quod ex ordinacione Christi haberet
potestatem coercendi delinquentes in foro ecclesie. Nec
tamen insufficienter providit ecclesie, quia ordinando
quod ecclesia haberet potestatem corrigendi disposuit
quod ecclesia sibi unum caput vel plura secundum
diversitatem provinciarum eligeret; ymmo dicunt quod
pro bono communitatis est ecclesie quod in potestate sit
ecclesie sibi unum caput vel plura eligere, quod eciam
vel que quando expediens videretur ecclesie posset
deponi. Cum ergo Christus optime providerit ecclesie in
potestate posuit ecclesie sibi unum caput vel plura
eligere. Sicut enim sepe expedit communitati unum
caput habere, ita interdum posset esse expediens
communitati regi a pluribus, sicut eciam nonnumquam
expedit rectorem habere perpetuum ita aliquando expedit
non rectorem perpetuum habere sed ad tempus. Et ideo
in quibusdam communitatibus secularibus non improvide
ordinatur quod rectores annis singulis vel post tres
menses vel post alium numerum mensium vel annorum
vel dierum suum resignent officium vel penitus
deponantur; in quibusdam eciam communitatibus non
unus solus sed plures preficiuntur regentes. Racio autem
predictorum assignatur quia in providendo regimini
alicuius communitatis non solum condiciones et mores
subditorum sed eciam condiciones et mores
preficiendorum oportet attendere. Et ideo quia potest
contingere quod in communitate non inveniatur aliquis
idoneus et sufficiens ut solus regimen super
communitatem accipiat, in tali casu non unus sed plures
communitatem utiliter gubernabunt. Quando autem in
communitate invenitur idoneus ut solus regat et subditi

Master: They grant that Christ did not by his decree
leave any head for the church which would have the
power to restrain those at fault in the forum of the
church. Nevertheless this was not an inadequate
provision for the church because by decreeing that
the church would have the power to correct he
arranged it that the church might choose for itself
one head or several according to the diversity of
provinces. Indeed, they say that it is for the good of
the community of the church that it is in the power
of the church to choose for itself one head or
several, either of which could be deposed when it
seemed appropriate to the church. Since Christ made
the best provision for the church, therefore, he put it
into its power to choose for itself one head or
several. For just as it is often convenient for a
community to have one head, so it could sometimes
be convenient for a community to be ruled by many,
just as it is also convenient sometimes to have a
perpetual ruler and at other times not a perpetual one
but one for a while. And so it is not incautiously
arranged in some secular communities that their
rulers resign their office or are completely deposed
every year or after three months or after some
number of months, years or days. In certain
communities also there is not one man alone set in
charge as ruler but several. Now an argument for the
above is provided by the fact that it is appropriate to
attend not only to the conditions and customs of the
subjects, when making provision for the rule of any
community, but also to the conditions and customs
of those who are to be put in charge. And therefore
