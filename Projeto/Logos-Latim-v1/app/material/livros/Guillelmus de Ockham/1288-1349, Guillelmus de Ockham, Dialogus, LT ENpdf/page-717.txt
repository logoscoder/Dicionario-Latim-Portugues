Item {*ibidem add. &NaRe} {ibi add. &MzPe}
subiungit {*subiungitur &NaRe}, "Interrogabant
{interrogabunt &NaRe} autem illum et milites
dicentes {trs. &Md}, `Quid faciemus et nos?' Et
ait illis, `Neminem concutiatis neque calumniam

autem contenti debeant {*debebant

&MzNaRe} verum dominium illorum quae {qui

non [[margin Md]] licet militibus recipere

There follows in the same place (Matthew
3:14), "Soldiers also asked him, `And we,
what should we do?' He said to them, `Do
not strike or make a false allegation
against anyone, and be satisfied with your
wages.'" If, however, they were to be
content with the wages which they
received from pagan princes, those infidel
princes had true lordship of what they
were giving the soldiers, because it would
not be permissible for soldiers to receive
wages from those who have nothing but
only tyrannically appropriate the goods of
others.

Item Iohannis 19 {10 &Md} :[11] dicit {*dixit
&MdMzNaRe} Iesus {om. &Na} {Christus
&PeRe} Pilato, "Non haberes in me {in me om.
&Na} potestatem ullam nisi data {*datum
&MzNaReVg} esset tibi {*trs.321 &MzNaRe}
desuper." Potestas autem desuper data {trs.
&Md} est legitima et non usurpata. Ergo Pilatus
habet {*habuit &MzNaPePzRe} legitimam
potestatem licet non legitime uteretur ea.

Again, at John 19:11 Jesus said to Pilate,
"You would have no power over me
unless it were given you from above."
Power given from above, however, is
legitimate and not usurped. Therefore
Pilate had legitimate power, although he
was not using it legitimately.

Item ad Romanos 13:[1] ait apostolus, "Omnis
anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita
{subiecta &NaRe} sit. Non est {om. &Re} enim
{om. &Md} potestas nisi a Deo; quae autem sunt
a Deo ordinata sunt." Ubi apostolus de
potestatibus infidelium {*infidelibus
&MdMzNaPeRe} loqui {loquitur &Mz} videtur,
de illis {aliis &MdPe} videlicet {a add. &Md}
[[interlinear]] quibus {trs. &Na} Romani
{Romanis &Md} praestaterunt {*praestiterunt
&LyNaPz} {praestitere &MzRe} {praestabantur
&Md} {praestabant &Pe} tributa. Dicente enim
{*om. &MzNaRe} apostolo, "Ideo enim tributa
praestatis." Et post, "Reddite ergo omnibus
debita. Cui tributum, tributum, cui vectigal,
vectigal." Romani autem non reddebant tributa
nisi Caesari et subditis {*succedentibus &Md}
eius qui erant infideles. Ergo infideles etiam
{*ibi &NaRe} {om. &MdPe} habuerunt {ibi

Again, the apostle says at Romans 13:1,
"Let every person be subject to the
governing authorities; for there is no
authority except from God, and those
authorities that exist have been instituted
by God." The apostle seems to be
speaking here about infidel authorities,
about those, that is, to whom the Romans
offered taxes. The apostle says [Romans
13:6,7], "For the same reason you pay
taxes ... Pay to all what is due them, taxes
to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom
revenue is due." The Romans, however,
used to pay taxes only to Caesar and his
successors, who were unbelievers.
Therefore unbelievers there had power
instituted by God, and so had true
temporal power.
