quia error contra fidem nullo potest stabilitatis manere
vigore. Sed opera generalis concilii omni manent
stabilita vigore, teste Ysidoro qui, ut recitatur dist. 15, c.
1, ait, "He sunt quatuor synodi principales fidem
nostram plenissime continentes. Sed si qua sunt alia
concilia que sancti patres spiritu Dei pleni sanxerunt
omni manent stabilita vigore." Ergo concilium generale
contra fidem errare non potest.

against faith, because an error against faith can not
persist with any force of stability. But the works of a
general council persist stable and most vigorous, as
Isidore attests. As is recorded in dist. 15, c. 1, he says
[col.34], "These are the four principal synods which
contain our faith most fully. But if there are any other
councils which holy fathers full of the spirit of God
have established they persist stable and most
vigorous." Therefore, a general council can not err
against faith.

Sexta racio est hec. Illa congregacio contra fidem errare
non potest cuius diffiniciones et determinaciones
tanquam universali consensu constitute sunt censende.
Universalis autem congregacio est concilium generale,
teste Gregorio qui, ut habetur dist. 15, c. Sicut, ait,
"Cunctas vero quas prefata veneranda concilia personas
respuunt, respuo, quas venerantur, amplector, quia, dum
universali sunt consensu constituta, se et non illa
destruit quisquis presumpserit absolvere quos ligant aut
ligare quos solvunt." Ergo concilium generale contra
fidem errare non potest.

A sixth argument is this. That congregation the
definitions and determinations of which should be
considered as established by universal consent can
not err against faith. The universal congregation,
however, is a general council, as Gregory attests
when he says, as we find at dist. 15, c. Sicut [col.35],
"All those people whom the aforesaid general
councils reject, I reject, those whom they honour, I
embrace, because, since they have been established
by universal consent, whoever presumes to loose
those whom they bind or to bind those whom they
loose destroys himself and not them." Therefore a
general council can not err against faith.

Discipulus Ista auctoritas Gregorii non videtur ad
propositum, quia beatus Gregorius loquitur ibi
solummodo de quatuor conciliis principalibus, non de
omnibus.

Student: That text of Gregory does not seem to be to
the point, because blessed Gregory is speaking there
only of the four principal councils, not of all
[councils].

Magister Ad hoc respondetur quod licet Gregorius
loquatur ibidem de quatuor principalibus conciliis,
tamen assignat racionem quare sunt recipienda, quia
scilicet sunt universali consensu constituta. Sed unum
concilium generale non est magis universali consensu
constitutum quam aliud, quia si sic unum esset magis
generale quam aliud; ymmo unum non esset generale.
Eadem autem causa et racio habet eundem effectum. Si
ergo quatuor principalia concilia sunt recipienda
omnino quia sunt universali consensu constituta, ergo et
omnia generalia concilia sunt recipienda quia sunt
universali consensu constituta; sed illa quatuor fuerunt
universali consensu constituta. Concilium autem quod
est omnino recipiendum et amplectendum contra fidem
errare non potest. Ergo nullum concilium generale
potest contra fidem errare.

Master: The reply to this is that although Gregory is
speaking there of the four principal councils, he does
nevertheless offer a reason why they should be
accepted, that is, because they have been established
by universal consent. But no one general council was
established with more universal consent than any
other, because if one were in this way more general
than another, one would in fact not be general.
However, the same cause and reason have the same
effect. Therefore, if those four councils should be
absolutely accepted because they were established
with universal consent, all general councils should
therefore also be accepted because they were
established with universal consent. But those four
were established with universal consent. A council
which ought to be absolutely accepted and embraced,
however, can not err against faith. Therefore, no
general council can err against faith.

Septima racio est hec. Illa congregacio cuius
constituciones et opera observanda et custodienda
decernuntur non potest contra fidem errare. Opera
autem et constituciones omnium conciliorum
generalium observanda et custodienda decernuntur,
teste Gelasio qui, ut habetur dist. 15, c. Sancta Romana,
ait, "Si qua sunt concilia a sanctis patribus hactenus
instituta post istorum quatuor auctoritatem, et

A seventh argument is this. That congregation the
constitutions and works of which it is decreed should
be observed and guarded can not err against faith. It
is decreed, however, that the works and constitutions
of all general councils should be observed and
guarded. Gelasius attests to this when he says, as we
find at dist. 15, c. Sancta Romana [col.36], "If there
are any councils established by holy fathers up till
