When therefore blessed James [1:12] says, &#8220;Blessed the man who endures temptation&#8221;, it must be
granted that here is promised the crown of life to the whole person, but this promise is purely affirmative, and
therefore from it there does not follow this negative, namely, &#8220;The crown of life is not promised to the
separated soul&#8221;. Also, assuming that in these words the crown of life was not promised to the separated
soul, it could not be inferred from this, except sophistically, that elsewhere the crown of life is not promised to
the separated soul; for often in sacred scripture something not promised in one place is promised in another.
Nevertheless, it can be said that in these words the crown of life is promised both to the whole person and to the
separated soul, and from this also, what is promised to the whole person after judgment is promised also to the
soul after it has been corporally purified.
And when he says, &#8220;it is certain that the soul is not the man&#8221;, this is a quibbling and childish
deduction. For if he wishes to prove altogether that the crown of life is not promised to the separated soul
because the soul is not a man, it will be proved to him that the crown of life is promised to no woman, because it
is certain that no woman is a man. But in blessed James&#8217;s text the crown of life is promised to both men
and women because by the word &#8220;men&#8221; he sub-understands women also, because in many things
what is said of men must be understood also of women. Thus also, although blessed James does not express the
word &#8220;soul&#8221;, nevertheless it is to be understood that from the fact that the crown of life is
promised to men, it is understood also to be promised to purified souls.
And when he says that &#8220;Christ says, &#8216;Everyone who leaves father and mother&#8217; etc.,
&#8216;will have eternal life&#8217; etc., it is certain that those to whom he spoke were persons, and not
separated souls&#8221;, all of this must be granted. But from this it does not follow that the vision of God is not
promised to souls, because from such an affirmative the negative does not follow. For Christ was speaking to
persons, and said some things to them not only for persons but also for their souls. And therefore when he also
said &#8220;will have eternal life&#8221;, he did not say this only for the person but also for the souls, after
they have been purified.
And when he says, &#8220;To the same conclusion is what Christ said, &#8216;You who leave all&#8217; etc.,
and it is certain that those who were there were Peter and other persons, and not their separated souls&#8221;, it
must be said that those words can be understood of persons only, because persons and not separated souls will sit
upon the throne judging the twelve tribes of Israel, but it does not follow that that honour is promised to persons
and not to separated souls.
When, finally, he says, &#8220;that reward will be rendered for works of mercy, whence Christ will say in the
judgment, &#8216;I thirsted&#8217; etc; but it is certain that persons, and not separated souls, gave alms;
therefore the reward will be rendered to the person, and not to the separated soul&#8221;, it must be said that the
reward will be rendered to many not for works of mercy; for many will be saved who have done absolutely no
work of mercy. And although that reward is to be rendered to many for works of mercy, it will not be rendered,
however, to those persons only for works of mercy, namely because the persons did works of mercy, but it will
be rendered for works of mercy also to their souls before the day of general judgment. It is clear, therefore, that
that argument, and the other arguments reported above, prove no more for the vision of God than they do about
living in heaven, because living in heaven is promised to the whole person in the same was as the vision of God
is.
Again, if that argument proved the heresy in question, it would follow by the same argument that before the day
of judgment no separated soul will be saved; and no separated soul will be damned, for just as the clear vision of
God is promised to the whole person, so Christ threatens damnation to the whole person if he does not believe,
when he says, as we read at the end of Mark [16:16], &#8220;Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved,
but whoever does not believe will be condemned&#8221;. In these words it is plainly certain that Christ speaks
of persons, because the whole person believes and is baptized. If, therefore, because of the fact that clear vision
of God is promised to the whole person it followed that separated souls would not see God, by the same
argument, from the facts that salvation is promised to the whole person and that Christ threatens damnation to
the whole person, it would be possible to infer that before the day of judgment separated souls will be neither
saved nor damned. No Catholic is ignorant of the fact that this is heretical.
CHAPTER 5
It continues in another way concerning the time for which the reward is promised. He says that
if we take note of holy scripture, the reward is found only after the judgment. First because after the judgment it
will be said, "Come blessed of my father, receive the kingdom", and also, "When the Son of man shall sit on the
throne of his Majesty you will also sit", etc; and this, "Rejoice, for your reward is great in heaven".
Here he lays down a third argument, from the time at which the reward will be paid, and it can be formulated as
follows. The reward, namely vision of God, will be paid only after the day of judgment; therefore the souls of
the saints will not see God before the day of judgment. The inference seems manifest. The premise is proved by
the text of Matthew 25[:34], "Come, blessed of my father, receive the kingdom", etc.
