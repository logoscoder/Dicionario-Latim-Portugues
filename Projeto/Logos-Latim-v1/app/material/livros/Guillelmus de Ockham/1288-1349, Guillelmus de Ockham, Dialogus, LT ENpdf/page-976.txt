deciduntur. Sed iurgia et litigia quae oriri
possunt ex causis innumeris inter clericos et
laicos aequius et convenientius deciduntur si
omnes tam clerici quam laici {*trs.321
&NaRe} habent {*habeant &NaRe} unum
summum {*supremum &NaRe} iudicem sub
quo omnes debent {*debeant &NaRe} litigare
quam si habeant plures iudices tales, scilicet
ecclesiasticum et secularem. Nam si orta
materia litis inter clericos et laicos coram
ecclesiastico iudice qui non sit summus
{*supremus &NaRe} iudex laicorum debeant
litigare merito laici habebunt eum suspectum.
Consimiliter si {om. &Na} debeant litigare
coram iudice seculari qui non est iudex
clericorum non indigne clerici habebunt eum
suspectum. Ergo absque rationabili suspicione
{*trs. &MzNaRe} non dirimetur litigium
aliquod inter clericos et laicos si non est
omnium unus iudex summus {*supremus
&NaRe}.

quarrels and disputes, to which the nature of
mortals is prone, are more equitably and
suitably settled. But quarrels and disputes
which can arise between clerics and laymen
for countless reasons are settled more
equitably and suitably if everyone, both
clerics and laymen, has one supreme judge
under whom all should litigate, than if there
are many such judges, that is an ecclesiastical
one and a secular one. For if a matter of
dispute has arisen between clerics and
laymen and they have to litigate before an
ecclesiastical judge who is not the supreme
judge of laymen, the laymen will justly
consider him suspect. Similarly if they have
to litigate before a secular judge who is not
the judge of clerics, the clerics will not
without reason consider him suspect. A
dispute between clerics and laymen,
therefore, will not be dissolved without
reasonable suspicion unless there is one
supreme judge of everyone.

Amplius ut communiter maiores et plures
occasiones discordiarum, contentionum,
seditionum, praeliorum et guerrarum ac
rixarum emergunt inter morantes simul quam
inter distantes si simul morantes non habent
unum iudicem summum {*supremum &NaRe}
{*trs. &MzNaRe} cuius metu ab huiusmodi
{huius &NaRe} refrenentur. Sed inter
distantes, valentes ad {*om. &NaRe} invicem
{*tamen add. &NaRe} communicationem
{*communionem &NaRe} habere, saepe
contingunt occasiones malorum huiusmodi
{huius &NaRe}. Ergo multo magis timendum
est ne talia inter morantes simul emergant nisi
habeant unum summum {*supremum &NaRe}
iudicem qui omnes impedientes tranquillitatem
et pacem habeat {*habeant &NaRe} coercere.

Further, as is commonly known, more and
greater opportunities for discord, strife,
sedition, battles, wars and brawls arise among
those living together than among those who
are distant, if those living together do not
have one supreme judge by fear of whom
they are restrained from things of this kind.
But among those who are distant, yet able to
have communion with each other,
opportunities for evils of this kind often come
to pass. It is therefore much more to be feared
that such things will arise among those living
together unless they have one supreme judge
who has the power to coerce those hindering
peace and tranquillity.

Again, no community of those living together
Rursus nulla communitas simul viventium vita is best regulated in its political life unless it is
politica est {trs.312 &Na} optime ordinata nisi one civilly. Whence also in regard to the
faithful, just as they are one body in Christ
sit civiliter una. Unde {*et add. &MzNaRe}
fideles, sicut sunt unum corpus in Christo (ad (Romans 12:5), so also they should be one
Romanos {ad Romanos: Joh. &NaRe} 12:[5]), body or college in civil life. But that
community which has various supreme
