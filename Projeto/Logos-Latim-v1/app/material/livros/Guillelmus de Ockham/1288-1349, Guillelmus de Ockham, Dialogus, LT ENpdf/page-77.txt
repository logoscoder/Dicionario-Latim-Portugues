hominum vel instantia fundare videtur. Damnatio
autem pravitatis haereticae et approbatio catholicae
veritatis eidem fundamento debent inniti. Ergo licet
papae approbando aliquam catholicam veritatem in
sapientia hominum vel voluntate aut instantia se
fundare, quod doctrinae apostolicae manifeste
repugnat. Ait enim Apostolus 1 ad Corinthios 2,
"Praedicatio mea non in persuasibilibus humanae
sapientiae verbis sed in ostensione spiritus et virtutis,
ut fides vestra non sit in sapientia hominum sed in
virtute Dei." Ex quibus verbis patenter habetur quod
fides papae non in sapientia hominum, et per
consequens multo magis nec in voluntate seu instantia
hominum, debet consistere. Quare nec approbatio
catholicae veritatis in sapientia hominum nec in
voluntate aut instantia debet fundari; et eadem ratione
damnatio heretice pravitatis non debet fundari in aliquo
predictorum. Papa igitur ad hoc quod rite damnet
haereticam falsitatem debet ad hoc vel per miraculum
apertum induci vel oportet eum cognoscere manifeste
quomodo talis falsitas veritati catholicae adversatur, ne
fidem suam in sapientia hominum vel voluntate
constituat.

condemnation of heretical wickedness, however, and
the approval of catholic truth, ought to rest on the
same foundation. Therefore it is licit for the pope in
approving some catholic truth to base himself on the
wisdom, will or insistence of men; and this is clearly
opposed to apostolic teaching. For in 1 Cor. 2[:4-5]
the apostle says, "My preaching was not in the
persuasive words of human wisdom, but in showing
of the Spirit and power, that your faith might not stand
on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God." We
clearly find from these words that the faith of the pope
should not take its stand on the wisdom of men and,
consequently, even more not on the will or insistence
of men. Nor should the approval of catholic truth,
therefore, be based on the wisdom of men, nor on
their will or insistence; and by the same argument the
condemnation of heretical wickedness ought not be
based on any of those things. For the pope to condemn
heretical falsity in a proper way, therefore, either he
should be led to this by an obvious miracle or he must
know clearly how such a falsity is opposed to catholic
truth, so that he does not establish his faith on the
wisdom or will of men.

Tertia ratio est haec. Propter illos qui possunt contra
fidem errare non est aliqua assertio neque tanquam
catholica approbanda neque tanquam haeretica
condemnanda. Sed omnes magistri in theologia et
etiam omnes alii a papa in generali concilio congregati
possunt contra fidem errare, quia nec magistri in
theologia nec omnes alii a papa in generali concilio
congregati sunt tota illa ecclesia pro qua Christus
oravit ne fides eius deficeret, licet si sint catholici sint
pars eiusdem ecclesiae, sicut quilibet christianus est
pars illius ecclesiae. Ergo propter omnes illos non
debet papa aliquam assertionem neque tanquam
catholicam approbare neque tanquam haereticam
condemnare nisi aperte ostendatur papae vel per
operationem miraculi vel per testimonium catholicae
veritatis quod a veritate nequaquam exorbitant.

[See Significant Variants, para. 8.] A third argument
is this. No assertion should be approved as catholic or
condemned as heretical on account of people who can
err against the faith. But all masters in theology and
even all others gathered together by the pope in a
general council can err against the faith, because
neither masters in theology nor all the others gathered
together by the pope in a general council make up that
whole church for which Christ prayed that its faith
would not fail, although if they are catholics they are
part of that church just as any christian is part of that
church. The pope should not, therefore, because of all
these approve any assertion as catholic or condemn it
as heretical unless it is clearly shown to him by the
working of a miracle or by the testimony of catholic
truth that they are not deviating from the truth.

Quarta ratio est haec. Papa non debet aliquam
assertionem
tanquam
haereticam
solenniter
condemnare nisi quam scit demonstrative vel
firmissime credit esse haereticam. Qui autem scit
demonstrative aliquam assertionem haereticam esse
rationi innititur. Qui vero credit innititur auctoritati.
Papa ergo in damnando aliquam assertionem tanquam
haereticam vel innititur rationi vel auctoritati. Sed papa
qui non videt quomodo damnanda assertio fidei obviat
orthodoxae rationi inniti non potest, sicut omni
intelligenti constat. Ergo oportet quod innitatur
auctoritati. Aut ergo innititur auctoritati divinae aut
humanae; non divinae quia non videt quomodo talis
assertio auctoritati divinae repugnat. Ergo papa si
damnaret praedicto modo aliquam assertionem
tanquam haereticam inniteretur auctoritati humanae.
Sed auctoritati humanae in his quae fidei sunt est

A fourth argument is this. A pope should not
solemnly condemn any assertion as heretical unless he
knows demonstratively or believes most firmly that it
is heretical. He who knows demonstratively that some
assertion is heretical, however, relies on reason, but he
who believes relies on authority. In condemning some
assertion as heretical, therefore, the pope relies either
on reason or on authority. But a pope who does not
see how an assertion to be condemned is opposed to
orthodox faith can not rely on reason, as is clear to
anyone with understanding. Therefore it is necessary
for him to rely on authority. He relies, therefore, either
on divine or on human authority; not on divine
authority because he does not see how such an
assertion is opposed to divine authority. Therefore if
the pope were to condemn some assertion as heretical
in the aforesaid way he would be relying on human
