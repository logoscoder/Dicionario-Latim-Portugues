[It is attacked] fifthly because the one
who is elected as emperor is crowned as a
king before he is crowned as emperor by
the pope. Every king, however, has the
power of the material sword. Therefore
before the emperor receives from the
pope the sword held in its sheath he has
the material sword, even with respect to
its use.

CAP. XXIII

CHAPTER 23

Discipulus Ista ratio {*responsio
&MdMzNaPePzRe} apparenter refellitur ad
quam postea forte redibimus. Ideo tange aliam
rationem {responsionem &Pz} ad eandem
conclusionem {*trs. &MzNaRe}.

Student That reply [[ratio or
responsio?]], to which perhaps we will
return later, is clearly refuted. So touch on
another argument for the same conclusion.

Magister Alia ratio talis est. Ab ipso {*illo
&MzNaPeRe} {episcopo &Pz} est potestas
Romani imperii qui a Christo recepit {suscepit
&Mz} potestatem ligandi omnia et solvendi. Sed
talem potestatem dedit Christus beato {om.
&MdMz} Petro, qui ut legitur Matth. 16:[18-9]
dicit {*dixit &MdMzNaPeRe} ei, "Tu es Petrus
et super hanc {et super hanc om. &Pe} etc
{petram edificabo ecclesiam meam &Md} usque
{*etc usque: petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et
porte inferi non praevalebunt adversus /om.
&Na\ eam. Et tibi dabo claves regni celorum et
quodcumque ligaveris super terram erit ligatum
et in celis et quodcumque solveris super terram
&MzNaRe} erit solutum et in {om. &Md}
coelis." Igitur {*ergo &MzNaRe} beatus Petrus
omnia potuit. Et per consequens [[et per
consequens: margin Md]] potuit [[interlinear
Md]] dare imperium imperatori {*trs.
&MzNaRe}.

Master [7] Another argument is as
follows. The power of the Roman empire
is from that person who received from
Christ the power of binding and loosing
everything. But Christ gave that power to
blessed Peter when he said to him, as we
read in Matthew 16:18-19, "You are Peter
and on this rock I will build my church
and the gates of Hades will not prevail
against it. And I will give you the keys of
the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you
bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
and whatever you loose on earth will be
loosed in heaven." Blessed Peter,
therefore, could do everything. And
consequently he could give the empire to
the emperor.
