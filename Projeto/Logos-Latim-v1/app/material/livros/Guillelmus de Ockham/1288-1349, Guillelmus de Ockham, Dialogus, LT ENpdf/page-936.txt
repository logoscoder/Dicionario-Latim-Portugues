Master The reply is that although now the
common canon law is that the clerics of a
cathedral church have the right to elect their
bishop, once this was not the common law,
but the common law was that the clergy and
people had the right to elect, and that law is
the more common and ancient one; and
therefore if every special privilege and law is
void, it is necessary to have recourse to the
most common and ancient law. Wherefore, if
all the cardinals become heretics, recourse
should be had to the more common and
ancient law and not to some more special law
of other churches. This law, however, is
divine law and the law of nations, and it is by
virtue of these laws that the right to choose
the supreme pontiff belongs to the Romans,
that is clergy and laymen.

And in this way is response made to the
argument for the third assertion, because
Et per hoc respondetur ad allegationes
although it once was the common law that the
