in Unity.
Qui vult ergo salvus esse, ita de
Trinitate sentiat.

He, therefore, who wishes to be
saved, must believe thus about the
Trinity.

Sed necessarium est ad aeternam
salutem, ut incarnationem quoque
Domini nostri Iesu Christi fideliter
credat.

It is also necessary for eternal
salvation that he believes steadfastly
in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus
Christ.

Est ergo fides recta ut credamus et
confiteamur, quia Dominus noster
Iesus Christus, Dei Filius, Deus et
homo est.

Thus the right faith is that we believe
and confess that our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, is both God
and man.

Deus est ex substantia Patris ante
saecula genitus: et homo est ex
substantia matris in saeculo natus.

As God, He was begotten of the
substance of the Father before time;
as man, He was born in time of the
substance of His Mother.

Perfectus Deus, perfectus homo: ex
anima rationali et humana carne
subsistens.

He is perfect God; and He is perfect
man, with a rational soul and human
flesh.

Aequalis Patri secundum divinitatem: He is equal to the Father in His
minor Patre secundum humanitatem. divinity, but inferior to the Father in
His humanity.

3

Qui licet Deus sit et homo, non duo
tamen, sed unus est Christus.

Although He is God and man, He is
not two, but one Christ.

Unus autem non conversione
divinitatis in carnem, sed
assumptione humanitatis in Deum.

And He is one, not because His
divinity was changed into flesh, but
because His humanity was assumed
unto God.

Unus omnino, non confusione
substantiae, sed unitate personae.

He is one, not by a mingling of
substances, but by unity of person.

Nam sicut anima rationalis et caro
unus est homo: ita Deus et homo
unus est Christus.

As a rational soul and flesh are one
man: so God and man are one Christ.

Qui passus est pro salute nostra:
descendit ad inferos: tertia die
resurrexit a mortuis.

He died for our salvation, descended
into hell, and rose from the dead on
the third day.

Ascendit ad caelos, sedet ad
dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis:
inde venturus est iudicare vivos et
mortuos.

He ascended into heaven, sits at the
right hand of God the Father
almighty. From there He shall come
to judge the living and the dead.
