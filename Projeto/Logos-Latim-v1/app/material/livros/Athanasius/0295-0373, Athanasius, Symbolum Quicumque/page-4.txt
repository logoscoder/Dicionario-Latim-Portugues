4

Ad cuius adventum omnes homines
resurgere habent cum corporibus
suis: et reddituri sunt de factis
propriis rationem.

At His coming, all men are to arise
with their own bodies; and they are
to give an account of their own
deeds.

Et qui bona egerunt, ibunt in vitam
aeternam: qui vero mala, in ignem
aeternum.

Those who have done good deeds
will go into eternal life; those who
have done evil will go into the
everlasting fire.

Haec est fides catholica, quam nisi
quisque fideliter firmiterque
crediderit, salvus esse non poterit.
Amen.

This is the Catholic faith. Everyone
must believe it, firmly and
steadfastly; otherwise He cannot be
saved. Amen.
