boundless being.

Similiter omnipotens Pater,
omnipotens Filius, omnipotens
Spiritus Sanctus.

Likewise, the Father is omnipotent,
the Son is omnipotent, the Holy
Spirit is omnipotent.

Et tamen non tres omnipotentes, sed
unus omnipotens.

Yet there are not three omnipotent
beings, but one omnipotent being.

Ita Deus Pater, Deus Filius, Deus
Spiritus Sanctus.

Thus the Father is God, the Son is
God, and the Holy Spirit is God.

Et tamen non tres dii, sed unus est
Deus.

However, there are not three gods,
but one God.

Ita Dominus Pater, Dominus Filius,
Dominus Spiritus Sanctus.

The Father is Lord, the Son is Lord,
and the Holy Spirit is Lord.

Et tamen non tres Domini, sed unus
est Dominus.

However, there as not three lords,
but one Lord.

Quia, sicut singillatim unamquamque
personam Deum ac Dominum
confiteri christiana veritate
compelimur: ita tres Deos aut
Dominos dicere catholica religione
prohibemur.

For as we are obliged by Christian
truth to acknowledge every Person
singly to be God and Lord, so too are
we forbidden by the Catholic
religion to say that there are three
Gods or Lords.

Pater a nullo est factus: nec creatus,
nec genitus.

The Father was not made, nor
created, nor generated by anyone.

Filius a Patre solo est: non factus,
nec creatus, sed genitus.

The Son is not made, nor created, but
begotten by the Father alone.

Spiritus Sanctus a Patre et Filio: non
factus, nec creatus, nec genitus, sed
procedens.

The Holy Spirit is not made, nor
created, nor generated, but proceeds
from the Father and the Son.

Unus ergo Pater, non tres Patres:
unus Filius, non tres Filii: unus
Spiritus Sanctus, non tres Spiritus
Sancti.

There is, then, one Father, not three
Fathers; one Son, not three sons; one
Holy Spirit, not three holy spirits.

Et in hac Trinitate nihil prius aut
posterius, nihil maius aut minus: sed
totae tres personae coaeternae sibi
sunt et coaequales.

In this Trinity, there is nothing
before or after, nothing greater or
less. The entire three Persons are
coeternal and coequal with one
another.

Ita ut per omnia, sicut iam supra
dictum est, et unitas in Trinitate, et
Trinitas in unitate veneranda sit.

So that in all things, as is has been
said above, the Unity is to be
worshipped in Trinity and the Trinity
